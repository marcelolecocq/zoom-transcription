1
000:00:00.800 --> 000:00:03.750
Marcelo Lecocq: Based on 2 s. Karun.

2
000:00:03.770 --> 000:00:09.390
Marcelo Lecocq: II think we can see the full of your screen. That is absolutely wonderful. Time starts now.

3
000:00:10.090 --> 000:00:38.930
Karum Singh: I so I'm main. My main finding was that the main source of traffic was Google and Meta. So we should increase our investment into these 2 sources. This is because Google had the main source of income, a main source of visits in 2020 at 12.003million views. Well, as a traffic source Meta was trailing at 3.006million however, that diverged. And I think this is due to investment changes. Google's investment went down 39.7, while meters went up 208.8%.

4
000:00:38.930 --> 000:01:07.770
Karum Singh: And I believe that the change in returns correlate with our investment. So I believe that in the short term we should increase investment in a Google met Meta to aim to maximize our potential gains, and then potentially we should take our Rtb. House and critique, but we should look deeper into the overall effect just because that they were declining from 2020 to 2021 for both sources, and in the long term, maybe Tiktok and Youtube which can be used as a branding emphasis for present branded items as well

5
000:01:07.900 --> 000:01:09.470
Karum Singh: think that's yeah. Digges

6
000:01:09.860 --> 000:01:18.489
Marcelo Lecocq: back on on 1 min, Kadun. Thank you very much for that. So everybody else now go and think about what Kadun has said

7
000:01:18.900 --> 000:01:22.459
Marcelo Lecocq: they. They ask on the brief

8
000:01:23.050 --> 000:01:33.710
Marcelo Lecocq: about simplicity, about visual supporting the findings, about structure and delivery. and go on Phil Karun's assessment, please.

9
000:01:55.230 --> 000:01:58.379
Marcelo Lecocq: hey? I can't see any any, any changes in the

10
000:01:59.590 --> 000:02:00.700
Marcelo Lecocq: in the poll.

11
000:02:03.940 --> 000:02:12.830
Jack C: I think you can only click, submit once you've answered all the questions. You're right, perhaps for us. So you you also meeting submitting numbers as we speak right?

12
000:02:13.080 --> 000:02:13.800
Yep.

13
000:02:14.240 --> 000:02:16.910
Marcelo Lecocq: Cool, but kind of I know it's difficult.

14
000:02:17.430 --> 000:02:22.069
robmadigan: Nice. Hello! Do you mind? Just. I can't seem to see the poll. It's gone. Listen for me.

15
000:02:22.950 --> 000:02:29.460
Marcelo Lecocq: Oh, right. So I'll tell you what. How. Why didn't we put your name. Then it came up originally, but it

16
000:02:29.550 --> 000:02:33.300
robmadigan: yeah. It seemed to come up originally, but then it went off. Is it hidden?

17
000:02:33.800 --> 000:02:36.350
robmadigan: I'm not sure

18
000:02:37.710 --> 000:02:42.099
Marcelo Lecocq: I can see, Robert, I can see you in the in the you're the third.

19
000:02:43.310 --> 000:02:48.640
robmadigan: Oh, yeah, I can see the sheet like the the the order. But I'm looking forward to.

20
000:02:50.180 --> 000:02:52.939
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay, so can you see?

21
000:02:53.500 --> 000:03:02.979
Marcelo Lecocq: Well, sorry. The spreadsheet may be different from the pool. Apologies for that. I don't. But you net. Your name is definitely there on the pool, which match what matches?

22
000:03:03.130 --> 000:03:06.919
robmadigan: Well, well, I have the spreadsheet. I just I can't see the poll, that's all I'm trying to say.

23
000:03:07.630 --> 000:03:13.779
Florine: But if you go under more, it says like polls and quizzes

24
000:03:14.090 --> 000:03:20.850
Florine: like the 3 dots on the right of your zoom call. And then I clicked on. Yeah, polls and quizzes, and then it popped up again.

25
000:03:21.070 --> 000:03:27.600
robmadigan: Oh, yeah, I see that. Okay, fair play. Thanks. That's it. Okay, perfect. So you were able to see. First of all, I wanted to say, Kadun.

26
000:03:27.610 --> 000:03:36.230
Marcelo Lecocq: Fantastic. Thank you very much. The first one is all was the most difficult one. So be kind. Took it in right? So can we have

27
000:03:36.560 --> 000:03:38.750
Marcelo Lecocq: the next person Elan is Lattrell.

28
000:03:46.520 --> 000:03:48.510
Marcelo Lecocq: We can see your screen. Look drill now.

29
000:03:52.980 --> 000:03:56.660
Marcelo Lecocq: You can see time starts now

30
000:03:57.560 --> 000:04:10.649
Latrell: as, the Kpa I've chosen to focus on today is also the click through rate from the line chart on the screen we can see that the click through rate for each channel. Google mets and Rtp house. And the second graph shows how much prison is spending for each of these ads

31
000:04:10.710 --> 000:04:21.769
Latrell: overall. We can see that message CTO is a lot more effective than Google's would almost double the rate at end of 2021. However. prism's total spending for Google is far more greater than Meta.

32
000:04:21.790 --> 000:04:34.799
Latrell: So from this I'd recommend that we allocate more of our market, spend on Meta rather than Google. As we can see. a lot more of our users are engaging with these ads. So essentially, by increasing the number of users, it will increase the number of users acquired.

33
000:04:35.190 --> 000:04:45.999
Latrell: And in addition, I'd also recommend, maybe venturing out to different ads platforms such as Tik tok, and perhaps implementing a B testing to measure its effect on this. In the first year, so

34
000:04:46.130 --> 000:04:55.369
Latrell: it doesn't have to be a substantial amount, maybe around 20 K. I think we should do this because tick tock is one of the fastest growing apps right now with over 1 1 billion monthly users.

35
000:04:55.430 --> 000:05:03.320
Latrell: So I'll add, could potentially reach a wider audience. And more specifically, thank you very much for that.

36
000:05:03.800 --> 000:05:05.710
Latrell: Yeah, it stops sharing that.

37
000:05:10.130 --> 000:05:24.629
Marcelo Lecocq: So each person here is going to have a different way of presenting different way of providing findings. There's no wrong right? Answer. There's some better and better and worse. But all of that. Your efforts are very much welcome at the moment.

38
000:05:25.330 --> 000:05:30.080
Marcelo Lecocq: so you can go ahead and and score a trail, please. That'd be wonderful.

39
000:05:56.640 --> 000:05:58.629
Marcelo Lecocq: Raise your hand if you've done.

40
000:05:59.020 --> 000:06:01.940
Marcelo Lecocq: I can see we can continue with the next person

41
000:06:04.210 --> 000:06:08.099
Marcelo Lecocq: fantastic. So let's get ready with the third person. Is that, Robin?

42
000:06:09.360 --> 000:06:14.810
Marcelo Lecocq: If you can share your screen, please, and I'm going to set my time at once. 1 min needs to be short

43
000:06:14.880 --> 000:06:16.209
Marcelo Lecocq: and snappy.

44
000:06:17.210 --> 000:06:18.920
Marcelo Lecocq: and when you're ready, rove it.

45
000:06:19.070 --> 000:06:23.850
robmadigan: Yep. gonna start up here. Yes, okay. So

46
000:06:24.340 --> 000:06:32.720
robmadigan: I'm gonna say we should prioritize Meta. Now, the evidence of this I'm going to show to I'm going to direct your attention to the left here in the Graphs

47
000:06:32.850 --> 000:06:48.449
robmadigan: for starters. We're just seeing a massive optic optic in meta clicks. Compared to everything else. It has grown substantially. and we can also see, based on the bottom graph that the price per click is a lot lower than the other 2 platforms that were analyzed.

48
000:06:48.560 --> 000:07:02.019
robmadigan: Based on this evidence, we simply have to increase our spending in Meta, and we need to consider reducing, advertising, spending towards R to be host. And that's kind of it, like, you know. Not sure sorry guys.

49
000:07:02.280 --> 000:07:03.340
robmadigan: Nice. A quick.

50
000:07:04.430 --> 000:07:06.720
Marcelo Lecocq: brilliant, brilliant. So once again.

51
000:07:06.860 --> 000:07:21.079
robmadigan: thank you very much for that. You can stop sharing now, Robert. Sorry I was, gonna say apologies now for the awkward angle and actually standard open by accommodation. I don't have a seat. Our table, so it's very awkward.

52
000:07:21.100 --> 000:07:29.320
Marcelo Lecocq: It's not, but it's it's fine. But Robert delivered something that didn't need the whole the whole minute.

53
000:07:29.430 --> 000:07:34.640
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay? And you need to assess whether he was able to deliver the message

54
000:07:34.710 --> 000:07:38.099
Marcelo Lecocq: in those 40 s. He used as well. Okay.

55
000:07:38.180 --> 000:07:55.230
Marcelo Lecocq: which is also something you can use in the future as well. You don't need to fill a whole minute if you don't need to. Sometimes you need more than a minute or 2 min, but here he did bang on inside the timing. So you need to assess what's he able to deliver the message impactfully in 40 s.

56
000:07:55.290 --> 000:07:59.230
Marcelo Lecocq: So please feel free to go on and and assess Robert, please.

57
000:08:12.420 --> 000:08:16.619
Marcelo Lecocq: and give me a quick natch to say whether you're ready.

58
000:08:16.850 --> 000:08:22.030
Marcelo Lecocq: And then, Victoria, feel free to go and share your screen and let me know when you're ready, so we can

59
000:08:24.460 --> 000:08:26.570
Marcelo Lecocq: so we can stop

60
000:08:26.670 --> 000:08:27.970
Marcelo Lecocq: clocking the time

61
000:08:33.740 --> 000:08:34.570
Marcelo Lecocq: ready.

62
000:08:34.890 --> 000:08:37.460
Victoria Sanders: Is that all up? And you can see all that?

63
000:08:37.650 --> 000:08:40.480
Victoria Sanders: Yes, yes, we can thank you. Great

64
000:08:44.200 --> 000:08:44.930
Marcelo Lecocq: good.

65
000:08:46.000 --> 000:08:53.700
Victoria Sanders: So my recommendation is to increase office to try and drive the value of the average order value up.

66
000:08:53.760 --> 000:09:13.870
Victoria Sanders: So in general, the average order value by month trended downwards in 2020, as can be seen in blue on the line graph on the left. While in 2021 it trended upwards. This was largely driven by a spike in the value from in the final quarter of the year from September to December.

67
000:09:13.990 --> 000:09:24.149
Victoria Sanders: Interestingly, this spike was also seen in the amount of transactions that were using coupons which increased drastically between September and December 2021

68
000:09:24.180 --> 000:09:30.899
Victoria Sanders: so increasing the amount of office that are on offer can increase the average order value

69
000:09:36.690 --> 000:09:39.819
Marcelo Lecocq: brilliant. Thank you very much, Victoria.

70
000:09:43.170 --> 000:09:47.580
Marcelo Lecocq: Now, once you make the connections you heard is Victoria

71
000:09:47.670 --> 000:09:52.039
Marcelo Lecocq: presenting. Think about everything that she said.

72
000:09:52.570 --> 000:10:00.359
Marcelo Lecocq: And is there a connection between the title, the Finding and the charts. We're looking for flow in the story as well. Okay.

73
000:10:01.590 --> 000:10:14.019
Marcelo Lecocq: and not just for Victoria. But I'm picking on Victoria because she was the last word. But for everybody is there? Is there a connection between the headline and the charts and the storage? She's trying, developing with the delivery.

74
000:10:16.390 --> 000:10:31.779
Marcelo Lecocq: And when you're ready, please score Victoria. We're going to choose the top 5 scorers at the end. Well, after I close the pool I won't share it with you. but I'll I'll talk to the other coaches, and we'll choose the 5 to go and present to James. Who is the CEO in this in this case, okay.

75
000:10:33.460 --> 000:10:40.590
Marcelo Lecocq: and we'll have a little debate at the end as well. What could have been done better? What could an. what elements we could have improved.

76
000:10:42.050 --> 000:10:49.189
Marcelo Lecocq: But remember, in real, in real life you'll have more than a minute. But you won't have 20 min, either. You're gonna have to be snappy

77
000:10:49.230 --> 000:10:53.769
Marcelo Lecocq: and assert assertive in how you deliver presentations and insights.

78
000:10:54.880 --> 000:11:01.739
Marcelo Lecocq: Is this, is this valuable? Does it push you a little bit more towards delivering snappy headlines

79
000:11:02.170 --> 000:11:14.239
Marcelo Lecocq: in week 8 of 9. I think you're going to have a whole week of storytelling that is going to be an exponential advance to your delivery capabilities for delivering insights. Yeah.

80
000:11:14.270 --> 000:11:25.740
Marcelo Lecocq: So we're just accelerating, trying to accelerate that process. Now, next person is Vivian. Vivian. You're ready to you ready to 2%.

81
000:11:27.640 --> 000:11:32.870
Vivian: Hi, sorry. Can I just do it without my just audio.

82
000:11:33.420 --> 000:11:35.460
Vivian: because my camera's not doing this here right now?

83
000:11:35.940 --> 000:11:39.179
Marcelo Lecocq: Vivian, were you able to prefer to prepare a slides.

84
000:11:39.470 --> 000:11:46.529
Vivian: Oh, yes, I'm just saying I've got it ready.

85
000:11:46.820 --> 000:11:55.389
Marcelo Lecocq: If you realize when you're presenting. I'm not sure you know most of the time I have not been able to see the faces while presenting so audio in this

86
000:11:55.570 --> 000:11:57.329
Marcelo Lecocq: in this setup should be, okay.

87
000:11:57.560 --> 000:11:58.900
Vivian: Okay. 1 s.

88
000:12:03.260 --> 000:12:04.700
Vivian: can you see my screen?

89
000:12:04.830 --> 000:12:08.670
Marcelo Lecocq: We can see your screen and your time time starts now.

90
000:12:10.560 --> 000:12:20.410
Vivian: Okay? So when it so I looked at the repeat customer rate, because when it comes to E. Commerce, custom, experience is extremely important, because if they have a good

91
000:12:20.410 --> 000:12:42.909
Vivian: and fast experiences are definitely gonna be back, which is good for long term, profitability and trust for a brand. So I looked at the rate of return in versus new customer. And this graph over here shows that new customers on average make one. Should they buy one item per order while returning customers buy like times 2 more. So, however, the total profit from new customer is like

92
000:12:42.960 --> 000:13:02.889
Vivian: times, 2 of returning customers. So my recommendation, based on that is that new customers can buy more items in their first transaction, which will also increase the amount of profit that the brand makes which is also good, you know, returning investments. My second recommendation is to have a very strong retention strategy.

93
000:13:02.890 --> 000:13:16.669
Vivian: so that more returning customers buy more items, which is, as this quote on the on the right here says, it's cheaper to get returning customers to buy things than getting new customers. Yeah, thank you.

94
000:13:16.710 --> 000:13:32.469
Marcelo Lecocq: No, no, thank you very much to you. You're doing a great job, and I'm not sure how different this is from your Kpis interview last week. Okay, but I'm I'm hoping different is a bit better cause I wasn't able to attend to to most of them.

95
000:13:32.730 --> 000:13:40.169
Marcelo Lecocq: But that's if this stop sharing, and you can all go to Vivian's assessment A and

96
000:13:40.570 --> 000:13:50.000
Marcelo Lecocq: and escort and the 3 elements was it. Impactful were were the visual supporting the story, and was the delivery strong enough to deliver that

97
000:13:50.040 --> 000:13:51.120
Marcelo Lecocq: narrative

98
000:14:01.510 --> 000:14:02.460
Marcelo Lecocq: beautiful?

99
000:14:02.920 --> 000:14:13.700
Marcelo Lecocq: We're progressing. Well, guys, we should be able to finish this before time next person in line is Andre Andre. Please feel free to go on and and share your screen.

100
000:14:17.360 --> 000:14:18.380
You see that

101
000:14:19.960 --> 000:14:25.620
Marcelo Lecocq: it's coming. Yes, we can see it, and your time starts now.

102
000:14:26.280 --> 000:14:32.599
Andrei Espenilla: So I wanted to look at was the North Star metric of prism, which is average basket value.

103
000:14:32.750 --> 000:14:34.680
Andrei Espenilla: I believe this is important because

104
000:14:34.880 --> 000:14:39.459
Andrei Espenilla: it represents long term growth for the business, which is something we always want to be pushing.

105
000:14:39.770 --> 000:14:41.930
Andrei Espenilla: And, as you can see here.

106
000:14:42.160 --> 000:14:50.630
Andrei Espenilla: the the value is steady and growing, and I wanted to see how we can improve this by looking at the top kind of top 3 products we have.

107
000:14:51.190 --> 000:14:54.490
Andrei Espenilla: and if they have a high average basket valued

108
000:14:54.640 --> 000:14:56.800
Andrei Espenilla: hi being defined as a

109
000:14:56.830 --> 000:15:10.720
Andrei Espenilla: more than the average right now, which is around 25, I concluded that we should stop. push more shoes, sales kind of stock them all because they are. We're selling a lot of them compared to number 2 and number 3, and they have a higher average basket.

110
000:15:10.730 --> 000:15:12.490
Andrei Espenilla: high average basket value.

111
000:15:12.610 --> 000:15:14.160
Andrei Espenilla: So yeah,

112
000:15:14.330 --> 000:15:15.359
Andrei Espenilla: that's what I think.

113
000:15:17.960 --> 000:15:21.769
Marcelo Lecocq: Thank you, Andrea. The same drilled everybody.

114
000:15:21.930 --> 000:15:25.059
Marcelo Lecocq:  Was that impactful

115
000:15:25.810 --> 000:15:31.409
Marcelo Lecocq: whilst the supporting visuals. impactful for the for the finding

116
000:15:31.960 --> 000:15:34.489
Marcelo Lecocq: and did the narrative work

117
000:15:50.600 --> 000:15:54.709
Marcelo Lecocq: was, Ernst is getting ready for his presentation

118
000:15:58.080 --> 000:15:59.140
Marcelo Lecocq: ready as.

119
000:16:00.040 --> 000:16:02.139
ernest: yeah, I'm just learning on the screen.

120
000:16:09.580 --> 000:16:12.390
Marcelo Lecocq: So are you having problems sharing your screen? Here it comes.

121
000:16:12.600 --> 000:16:13.470
Yeah.

122
000:16:20.130 --> 000:16:23.010
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay, here we go on your own time ready?

123
000:16:23.420 --> 000:16:32.119
ernest: Yeah. So I decided to look at the customer to member conversion rate. So, as you can see in 2,020 does 8.0067 conversion rate.

124
000:16:32.170 --> 000:16:37.909
ernest: So after 126,000 customers, you had in 2,020, only 11,000 that were actually customers.

125
000:16:38.070 --> 000:16:48.960
ernest: So as a ecommerce business, you want roughly 30 to 40% of customers to be pop, part of the membership loyalty scheme so ideally, you'd want, say, 1,000 customers. So.

126
000:16:49.290 --> 000:16:53.349
ernest: moving forward, I think personally, could highlight the benefits of becoming a room

127
000:16:53.440 --> 000:17:08.810
ernest: website. So I high highlighted the discounts. How much money you could save the deals that you can get. Also, we should look into having different brand activities, activations and partnerships where we can promote prism and other brands which would attract a lot more people

128
000:17:09.020 --> 000:17:12.329
ernest: and also utilizing influences to widen reach.

129
000:17:12.760 --> 000:17:28.280
ernest: So all these recommendations are important as as we move forward trying to increase the amount of people that shop up is having. Loyal customers always benefit us, and having a cool group of people that come back to us. I think that will benefit us in the long term. So

130
000:17:28.680 --> 000:17:30.879
Marcelo Lecocq: sorry to have to stop you very

131
000:17:30.940 --> 000:17:35.260
Marcelo Lecocq: in your presentation, guys, but if we don't follow, the

132
000:17:35.610 --> 000:17:39.099
Marcelo Lecocq: the structure will be here until midnight

133
000:17:39.290 --> 000:17:40.540
Marcelo Lecocq: apologies for that.

134
000:17:41.010 --> 000:17:45.420
Marcelo Lecocq: Thank you. Thank you very much for that. Once again, centre. Please go unscore. Ernst.

135
000:17:45.430 --> 000:17:49.090
Marcelo Lecocq: on his delivery, on his impact on his visuals.

136
000:17:54.420 --> 000:17:58.179
Marcelo Lecocq: Is this the first time you guys getting exposed to each other's presenting?

137
000:17:59.700 --> 000:18:03.879
Marcelo Lecocq: Oh, fantastic. So you, seeing different things, you can learn from each other all right.

138
000:18:05.610 --> 000:18:13.230
Marcelo Lecocq: That's really. I'm hoping that that nod is. It's a positive thing. Is that is that a good exercise to see each others presenting?

139
000:18:14.460 --> 000:18:19.179
Marcelo Lecocq: Oh, lol, lot lot more nodding. That's good. That's good. Okay, Florine Bliss. Could you get ready?

140
000:18:21.010 --> 000:18:22.180
Florine: Yes.

141
000:18:25.450 --> 000:18:26.800
Florine: okay.

142
000:18:27.980 --> 000:18:29.420
Marcelo Lecocq: ready. Go.

143
000:18:30.190 --> 000:18:32.149
Florine: Can you see that? Okay, yeah.

144
000:18:33.330 --> 000:18:49.420
Florine: Okay, cool. One big challenge for prism is their low conversion rate. So the average conversion rate of prism in 2021 was 0 point 59 where our main competitor, Aco, saw a conversion rate of 3.001in 2021.

145
000:18:49.420 --> 000:19:07.629
Florine: Once splitting the conversion rate out by device, we can see that the conversion rate is especially low for mobile devices at 0 point 38% with 80% of our traffic coming from mobile devices. I think we should focus on mobile optimization as there is a huge revenue opportunity there.

146
000:19:07.630 --> 000:19:35.699
Florine: I suggest, we create and implement a new mobile, responsive website via A B testing to find tune the mobile experience and unlock the full potential or mobile traffic. We can experiment with different elements of the website, including buttons for the placements and checkout pro process variations to identify what the most effective conversions

147
000:19:36.140 --> 000:19:37.470
Marcelo Lecocq: it's

148
000:19:37.650 --> 000:19:42.009
Marcelo Lecocq: let's go on this call, Floreen. Once we get ready for Juliette.

149
000:19:43.180 --> 000:19:46.880
Florine: I'll try and share my screen, but I don't know.

150
000:19:47.990 --> 000:19:49.170
Florine: so

151
000:19:49.340 --> 000:19:54.229
Marcelo Lecocq: there must be a little red button, either in your first screen or your second screen.

152
000:19:54.790 --> 000:19:56.020
Marcelo Lecocq: That

153
000:19:56.110 --> 000:20:00.900
Florine: yeah, I'm just trying to get zoom up properly again. But

154
000:20:02.070 --> 000:20:04.969
Florine: hmm! Sorry. I don't know what I'm doing.

155
000:20:08.820 --> 000:20:11.210
Florine: Oh.

156
000:20:11.850 --> 000:20:13.490
Florine: hmm!

157
000:20:15.090 --> 000:20:15.880
Florine: Stop!

158
000:20:16.220 --> 000:20:21.319
Marcelo Lecocq: Sounds cool, please, Florine.

159
000:20:21.510 --> 000:20:26.929
Marcelo Lecocq: go on school, Florine on the free elements, and, Juliet, if you could get ready. That would be wonderful

160
000:20:30.370 --> 000:20:32.349
Marcelo Lecocq: beautiful Julia, you ready

161
000:20:34.890 --> 000:20:40.230
juliette amauger: almost. Can you see my screen? Yes.

162
000:20:41.600 --> 000:20:42.720
juliette amauger: go for it.

163
000:20:43.570 --> 000:20:51.430
Okay, so we should improve the descriptions and size guides of our product to reduce the return and return rates.

164
000:20:51.590 --> 000:21:00.000
juliette amauger: So in 2020 and 2021 depending on the category of the product we had the written and refund rate between

165
000:21:00.030 --> 000:21:03.030
juliette amauger: 33% and 8%

166
000:21:03.320 --> 000:21:16.720
juliette amauger: averaging around 20%. So this means that for every product we send one out of 5 is coming back to our warehouse because the client was not receiving what they were expecting.

167
000:21:17.330 --> 000:21:34.720
juliette amauger: and so I think we should be able to provide a better description and size guide for products, because the clients cannot try them before before they buy them, especially for the shoes and box category, where one out of 3 products was sent back.

168
000:21:37.990 --> 000:21:39.220
Marcelo Lecocq: Thank you, Florine.

169
000:21:40.600 --> 000:21:42.530
juliette amauger: That was Peter's book.

170
000:21:42.840 --> 000:21:50.700
Marcelo Lecocq: So so apologies, Juliet. Julia apologies. Thank you, Julia. So if you can all. Go on to school, Juliet, please.

171
000:21:55.210 --> 000:22:00.099
Marcelo Lecocq: I want to have enough time at the end to debate and discuss their different approaches.

172
000:22:02.140 --> 000:22:07.200
Rami: and if we can have ramit getting ready, please? That'd be wonderful.

173
000:22:15.100 --> 000:22:16.600
Rami: Second.

174
000:22:19.930 --> 000:22:21.410
Rami: you can see the screen.

175
000:22:21.480 --> 000:22:26.069
Marcelo Lecocq: Yeah. But we can also see some black elements on on it.

176
000:22:27.650 --> 000:22:30.379
Marcelo Lecocq: Can you also see black elements, Guy. So some

177
000:22:31.160 --> 000:22:36.650
Marcelo Lecocq: containers hiding the slide. I think you might have to close some screens as good.

178
000:22:37.940 --> 000:22:42.229
Rami: You can see it now. No, the bottom. We conceal some black?

179
000:22:43.070 --> 000:22:46.119
Rami: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah. I have to.

180
000:22:46.140 --> 000:22:47.319
Rami: Is it all right now?

181
000:22:47.820 --> 000:22:50.179
Yeah, I think we can see the slides. Yes.

182
000:22:50.970 --> 000:23:13.110
Rami: okay. So I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be talking about click through rate between Southern 21, we can see decrease and click through rate and Southern 21 which result of of the decrees of click of Rtb house clicks and Google clicks and Southern 21 compared to southern 20

183
000:23:13.190 --> 000:23:18.340
Rami: which the only the only click that has increased is meta clicks.

184
000:23:18.370 --> 000:23:25.220
Rami: I think we should stop investing in Rtb house that have low low amount of clicks

185
000:23:25.530 --> 000:23:28.689
Rami: and try to reduce the investment. Google clicks.

186
000:23:28.850 --> 000:23:34.959
Rami: We can see the decrease and try to put all most of the investment in meta clicks

187
000:23:35.080 --> 000:23:41.840
Rami: which which in that way can increase the click through rate for their future years.

188
000:23:43.730 --> 000:23:44.630
Rami: That's all.

189
000:23:44.790 --> 000:23:46.289
Marcelo Lecocq: Thank you. Thank you, Rami.

190
000:23:48.770 --> 000:23:52.569
Marcelo Lecocq: and stop sharing. And let's go on the school, Rammy, please. Wonderful

191
000:23:53.800 --> 000:23:56.729
Marcelo Lecocq: governing. If you could get ready, please. That'd be wonderful as well

192
000:24:08.310 --> 000:24:09.889
Marcelo Lecocq: beautiful when you're ready.

193
000:24:10.600 --> 000:24:14.620
gavneet johal: My camera isn't working, so it'll just be audio, only that's why I go.

194
000:24:15.090 --> 000:24:34.310
gavneet johal: So I decided to look at the conversion rate, and in 2020 we can see that there was a conversion rate of 0 point 6% and this is when the customers viewed item and to when they purchased it in 2021 that has decreased to 0 point 5 one, even though the amount of customers that viewed an item has increased significantly.

195
000:24:34.310 --> 000:24:50.109
gavneet johal: my suggestion would be to invest marketing funds in other platforms, such as Criteria, Instagram, and the website itself, as you can see from this chart in the bottom, that total views not only come from Google, Meta and Rtb House, but also directly from the website and criteria and email

196
000:24:53.890 --> 000:24:59.320
Marcelo Lecocq: beautiful that you are the second one to finish in 40 in. Under 40 s. Thank you very much. Governet.

197
000:25:00.410 --> 000:25:02.589
Marcelo Lecocq: Has cavity been able to

198
000:25:02.790 --> 000:25:07.409
Marcelo Lecocq: rang you through the story with her charts, and a statement at the

199
000:25:07.560 --> 000:25:11.909
Marcelo Lecocq: as a headline. because can we all go into school? Govni

200
000:25:22.400 --> 000:25:25.209
Marcelo Lecocq: beautiful? Let's get ready for Alexand

201
000:25:28.410 --> 000:25:29.820
Marcelo Lecocq: Alex when you ready.

202
000:25:34.510 --> 000:25:35.869
Marcelo Lecocq: I think you're a mood.

203
000:25:40.080 --> 000:25:41.690
Marcelo Lecocq: Alex. I think you're on mute.

204
000:25:46.770 --> 000:25:51.539
Alex Kononov: Can. Can can you see the screen now? We can see your screen and we can hear you now.

205
000:25:51.930 --> 000:26:13.739
Alex Kononov: Okay, great. So as many of my colleagues. I have chosen their click through rates since it allows to measure the advertisements campaign efficiency. It helps measuring add engagements relevance. And it's campaign optimization.

206
000:26:13.950 --> 000:26:28.370
Alex Kononov: We can see, that's Meta leaves leads with the highest results followed by Google with ought to be housed in the third place, with constantly and significantly lowest results.

207
000:26:28.390 --> 000:26:51.039
Alex Kononov: And based on these observations, it seems that we should increase our investments in Meta, optimize Google advertising for the better outreach to a more targeted audience and to redirect our resources from Rtb House to a more efficient platform.

208
000:26:51.300 --> 000:26:52.130
Alex Kononov: Thank you.

209
000:26:52.560 --> 000:26:54.910
Marcelo Lecocq: Bang on on time. Thank you very much.

210
000:26:57.430 --> 000:27:00.159
Marcelo Lecocq: Same drill team, please. Can we go into school.

211
000:27:01.660 --> 000:27:11.109
Alex Kononov: Alex? Yeah, I'm trying to get ready. That'd be wonderful place.

212
000:27:11.730 --> 000:27:12.550
Alex Kononov: Sorry

213
000:27:13.610 --> 000:27:15.599
Marcelo Lecocq: we're nearly halfway through now.

214
000:27:41.880 --> 000:27:43.120
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay, Owen.

215
000:27:44.250 --> 000:27:48.899
Owen Parks: So one challenge, E, commerce companies buy face

216
000:27:48.910 --> 000:27:55.410
Owen Parks: is keeping up with customer behavior trends. The data shows that in

217
000:27:55.610 --> 000:28:07.899
Owen Parks: 2021 total mobile sessions increased whilst desk options decreased. I wanted to visualize the effect this had on monthly revenue in the line trial, and, as you can see

218
000:28:08.310 --> 000:28:12.180
Owen Parks: in 2021 monthly revenue is below

219
000:28:12.530 --> 000:28:17.980
Owen Parks: 2020 monthly mobile revenue up until August, in which there's a drastic spike.

220
000:28:18.150 --> 000:28:23.490
Owen Parks: I wanted to investigate this spike. And I found that this was facilitated by

221
000:28:23.530 --> 000:28:26.130
Owen Parks: Google direct and

222
000:28:26.160 --> 000:28:27.530
Owen Parks: Meta marketing.

223
000:28:28.130 --> 000:28:34.360
Owen Parks: So my recommendation is to optimize marketing by aggressively targeting

224
000:28:34.770 --> 000:28:39.019
Owen Parks: the periods before these spikes and using the most

225
000:28:39.170 --> 000:28:42.430
Owen Parks: efficient marketing sources that we have

226
000:28:45.610 --> 000:28:47.999
Marcelo Lecocq: bang on time. Thank you very much, Owen.

227
000:28:52.090 --> 000:28:56.419
Marcelo Lecocq: Thank you. So all of you think about that headline.

228
000:28:56.560 --> 000:29:00.439
Marcelo Lecocq: Think about how he delivered the presentation and the narrative.

229
000:29:03.440 --> 000:29:13.890
Marcelo Lecocq: I think we're good at challenge with Sonia hasn't been able to produce a slice, and she apologized on the chat. if I'm not mistaken and

230
000:29:18.570 --> 000:29:32.479
Marcelo Lecocq: and also sajing, so we may have 2 drops. So we're gonna unfortunately don't. Don't. We're gonna nobody be able to score Sonia. But we can score Michael. So, Michael, if you don't mind start sharing your screen.

231
000:29:33.340 --> 000:29:34.530
Michael: Yep.

232
000:29:40.520 --> 000:29:42.120
Michael: Can you confirm when you sit?

233
000:29:42.380 --> 000:29:43.270
Marcelo Lecocq: Yep.

234
000:29:43.410 --> 000:29:45.100
Michael: okay, excellent.

235
000:29:46.870 --> 000:29:56.009
Michael: and give me a sign when you start the timer ready for what? So my recommendation is to

236
000:29:56.300 --> 000:30:07.520
Michael: get more traffic from sites like Avin and Yahoo, unless from tick, Tock and Meta. because it seems they are driving our conversion rates down.

237
000:30:07.940 --> 000:30:16.730
Michael: as you can see on the graph on the bottom left here. I have compared our average conversion rate against the benchmark for

238
000:30:17.000 --> 000:30:18.570
Michael: the e-commerce fashion

239
000:30:18.780 --> 000:30:26.639
Michael: sector, and we have significantly performed below this benchmark in both 2,021 and 2,022.

240
000:30:26.980 --> 000:30:30.400
Michael: So I've had a look at the best performing

241
000:30:30.650 --> 000:30:33.570
Michael: traffic sources in terms of conversion. Rates and

242
000:30:34.500 --> 000:30:41.319
Michael: a Win and Yahoo are definitely the best performance in both here and Tiktok and Meta are the worst. So I would recommend.

243
000:30:41.830 --> 000:30:42.950
Michael: and

244
000:30:43.930 --> 000:30:51.979
Michael: maybe increasing our advertising on this top performing websites in order to increase the conversion. I'm afraid.

245
000:30:53.050 --> 000:30:53.870
Michael: Perfect.

246
000:30:54.060 --> 000:30:57.539
Marcelo Lecocq: Thank you same school. I think we're progressing really. Well.

247
000:30:57.870 --> 000:31:03.319
Marcelo Lecocq: Do we have a headline? Do we have visuals supporting that headline whilst was the

248
000:31:03.770 --> 000:31:04.920
Marcelo Lecocq: was the

249
000:31:05.330 --> 000:31:09.980
Marcelo Lecocq: the presenter able to persuade you on his or her statements.

250
000:31:18.450 --> 000:31:20.500
Marcelo Lecocq: Next one in line is Kelly

251
000:31:21.180 --> 000:31:24.900
kelly: fantastic? Feel free to start sharing when you

252
000:31:25.230 --> 000:31:26.249
Marcelo Lecocq: when you're ready.

253
000:31:26.690 --> 000:31:35.630
kelly:  Oh.

254
000:31:47.170 --> 000:31:48.240
kelly: okay.

255
000:31:49.530 --> 000:31:50.729
kelly: here we come. Yes.

256
000:31:51.190 --> 000:31:55.170
Marcelo Lecocq: yeah, it's coming when you're ready. And I'll start timing you.

257
000:31:55.370 --> 000:32:00.780
kelly: Okay, let's go. Okay. After analyzing this 2 years of.

258
000:32:00.790 --> 000:32:09.819
kelly: I noticed that the percentage of return product including resound on exchange is 27%. This is high

259
000:32:09.970 --> 000:32:19.450
kelly: on the left. You can see that the brand with the highest number of returns is to actually increase with 34,000,

260
000:32:19.500 --> 000:32:28.889
kelly: but the quantity, the third quantity salt is also high. all those brands they all have the same the similar behavior.

261
000:32:29.030 --> 000:32:31.920
kelly: So it was necessary to analyze more in detail.

262
000:32:32.060 --> 000:32:45.089
kelly: and something I noticed is, there is no way. There is no way to understand the reason why of those return product. So the first thing is adding the option to justify the reason.

263
000:32:45.280 --> 000:32:50.889
kelly: And then I can suggest to maybe set a target like 75%

264
000:32:51.060 --> 000:32:52.809
kelly: and consider to

265
000:32:53.200 --> 000:33:02.499
kelly: stop selling the the product with the Kelly finish.

266
000:33:03.070 --> 000:33:09.059
Marcelo Lecocq: Thank you very much. It's tough, isn't it? Stuff to try to fit everything in 1 min?

267
000:33:09.370 --> 000:33:20.179
Marcelo Lecocq: But it's also very tough, actually having to prepare and rehearse for your presentation to make it fit in 1 min. Okay, the most important thing guys, you need to fit the message

268
000:33:20.280 --> 000:33:22.829
Marcelo Lecocq: in 1 min. Okay, everything else.

269
000:33:23.250 --> 000:33:31.240
Marcelo Lecocq: That's why the headline is so important for everybody. Right? The whole idea is the headline for

270
000:33:31.430 --> 000:33:40.300
Marcelo Lecocq: for delivering that first bench line. Now, can we all score, Kelly, before we proceed with we. Jc.

271
000:33:40.430 --> 000:33:41.400
Marcelo Lecocq: gc.

272
000:33:42.290 --> 000:33:49.380
Michael: sorry, Marcello. I suspect we won't be able to submit unless we rate ourselves. Do you think we should write all ourselves as well.

273
000:33:50.560 --> 000:34:01.580
Marcelo Lecocq: You. You're right. You're right. So apologies sets go. You need to rate yourself. You absolutely right. Tha, that's do you get.

274
000:34:01.710 --> 000:34:17.830
Marcelo Lecocq: because they're all compulsory. So everybody has to answer every every question. If you're not able to answer every question, you won't be able to submit. That's correct. So no, no in, I think, will be decent to put freeze

275
000:34:18.230 --> 000:34:24.850
Marcelo Lecocq: if you have to raid yourself once I go. Well, great find find out, Michael.

276
000:34:24.880 --> 000:34:31.590
Marcelo Lecocq: please read yourself as 3. Thou will not sway the average left or right. Okay, cool

277
000:34:33.270 --> 000:34:38.100
Marcelo Lecocq: now. So we got at Gc, ready.

278
000:34:39.960 --> 000:34:41.680
GC Storino: Okay, just give me a calendar.

279
000:34:41.929 --> 000:34:42.719
Marcelo Lecocq: Good.

280
000:34:43.400 --> 000:35:07.080
GC Storino: Okay. I believe that we, that prisoner as a company should be moving towards outware cosmetics and suits and tops, and moving away from accessories and homeware, as we can see, while between 20 and 20 2020 and 2020 21, we have increased products sold by 115 K accessories have dropped by 60% homework by 42%. Meanwhile, the outware cosmetics and suits by 50, 28 and 16 respectively.

281
000:35:07.140 --> 000:35:08.170
GC Storino: Respectively.

282
000:35:10.560 --> 000:35:11.290
GC Storino: That's it

283
000:35:11.750 --> 000:35:19.510
Marcelo Lecocq: good. fantastic. So once again. guys go on a score. Gc.

284
000:35:19.850 --> 000:35:21.869
Marcelo Lecocq: And was impactful.

285
000:35:21.920 --> 000:35:28.099
Marcelo Lecocq: Did it deliver the story? Was he able to persuade you with his charts and and narrative.

286
000:35:33.970 --> 000:35:36.380
juliette amauger: master, do I have one quick question.

287
000:35:36.390 --> 000:35:58.640
juliette amauger: one more question. If we need to order, or the names in the Port should we also put all 3 for Sonyan, sergeant that don't have a presentation. Please do so. Yes, that's correct. This my bad of planning this wrongly on the choices of compulsory. And I think I set everything to be compulsory before you guys submit. That's correct.

288
000:35:59.020 --> 000:36:00.090
Marcelo Lecocq: Yes, please.

289
000:36:01.370 --> 000:36:04.699
Marcelo Lecocq: We'll deal with that issue at at the very end. Okay?

290
000:36:05.320 --> 000:36:08.310
Marcelo Lecocq: And now we go hammer.

291
000:36:09.920 --> 000:36:11.110
Hamna Amer: how are you ready?

292
000:36:13.520 --> 000:36:16.809
Hamna Amer: Okay, so I'm going to start now. And does it go?

293
000:36:17.010 --> 000:36:43.740
Hamna Amer: Okay? So I looked at how effective websites are on different devices. And I suggest that we should invest 60% in mobile websites to increase purchases. This is because web mobile had 27 million total views. For their website. Ho! Which is the highest. However, it had 0 point 6 5% conversion rate for purchases, which was the lowest compared to desktop and tablet.

294
000:36:44.050 --> 000:36:57.199
Hamna Amer: Therefore we should try to increase the purchases of mobile websites which can be done using coupons or at apple pay, which is, gonna be fast and quicker to make a purchase. Therefore increasing purchases in mobile websites.

295
000:36:58.720 --> 000:37:11.720
Marcelo Lecocq: Thank you. Beautiful. Thank you very much. With your 40 s. That's really really good. I mean really good to get if you able to persuade the audience that on your messaging. Thank you, Anna. Can we all score. Hama, please.

296
000:37:14.480 --> 000:37:17.120
Marcelo Lecocq: So let me stop quickly. Here is this working?

297
000:37:17.290 --> 000:37:22.879
Marcelo Lecocq: Yeah. Can can you see the different presentation styles the different tools that people are using.

298
000:37:23.260 --> 000:37:35.010
Marcelo Lecocq: I can see some activity or not. It may not work for everybody, but I think towards week, 8 or 9, you're going to start thinking. This is really valuable, and is something we have to work better at

299
000:37:35.790 --> 000:37:38.179
Marcelo Lecocq: Muhammad. Can you start getting ready, please.

300
000:37:46.940 --> 000:37:48.180
Marcelo Lecocq: ready when you are.

301
000:37:49.060 --> 000:37:51.760
Muhammad Sabbagh: let me know when to start, and I'll start my timer.

302
000:37:52.180 --> 000:37:53.909
Marcelo Lecocq: Let's start right now.

303
000:37:55.040 --> 000:38:07.060
Muhammad Sabbagh: Alright. So I decided to focus on the click through rate compared to the average spend for each website or complete source. So what we saw see here is that Meta platform exhibits the higher Ctr amongst the analyzed platforms in 1 s.

304
000:38:07.060 --> 000:38:27.040
Muhammad Sabbagh: indicating that the audience engages more effectively with ads through Meta, Google and Rtp House. Both follow with relatively lower but still considerable Ctr suggesting moderate engagement levels. We can also see there's an absence of data for Tiktok and Gritty. So there is a higher spend on Google than there is on Meta, as we can see. So I'd allocate more advertising budget towards Meta platform to do to its higher Ctr

305
000:38:27.260 --> 000:38:41.419
Muhammad Sabbagh: in addition to that, I'd also rectify any issues in data collection for tracking mechanisms, for Tiktok and Gritty, so that we can accurately measure those sources. Because, as we know, Tiktok is quite up and coming. So it's probably fo good to focus and see whether or not we can use it or leverage it. So

306
000:38:43.020 --> 000:38:45.000
Marcelo Lecocq: thank you. Thank you very much, Mohammed.

307
000:38:46.490 --> 000:38:50.609
Marcelo Lecocq: If you can stop. That'd be wonderful.

308
000:38:51.130 --> 000:38:52.580
Muhammad Sabbagh: 1 s

309
000:38:54.320 --> 000:38:57.459
Marcelo Lecocq: got it. Thank you. And if we can all score

310
000:38:59.050 --> 000:39:00.640
Marcelo Lecocq: Mohammed, please.

311
000:39:01.820 --> 000:39:04.379
Marcelo Lecocq: And, Peter, if you can get ready, that'd be wonderful.

312
000:39:21.640 --> 000:39:29.160
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay, sorry. I can. You see? See what I'm looking at? Yes, we can think so. I'll start the counting right now. Go.

313
000:39:29.540 --> 000:39:36.040
Peter Shatwell: Okay. So I think prism should continue to invest in product quality and accurate product descriptions.

314
000:39:36.110 --> 000:39:39.499
Peter Shatwell: Overall. Prism's item return rate is decreasing.

315
000:39:39.570 --> 000:39:54.840
Peter Shatwell: This is a positive sign as it points to an increase in custom, satisfaction as more products resonate with prism's customer base. and a decreasing trend in return rate counters common concerns of sustainability and overconsumption in the fast fashion industry.

316
000:39:55.060 --> 000:40:00.180
Peter Shatwell: So lowering the return rate is not only good for prism, but good for the environment.

317
000:40:00.270 --> 000:40:09.450
Peter Shatwell: And I think prism can continue to lower the return rate. If it maintains a focus on improving product quality and ensuring accurate product descriptions.

318
000:40:11.020 --> 000:40:12.080
Peter Shatwell: Okay, thank you.

319
000:40:12.860 --> 000:40:14.339
Marcelo Lecocq: Thank you very much, Peter.

320
000:40:15.830 --> 000:40:26.280
Marcelo Lecocq: It's like, if you can stop sharing and everyone can score Peter, it's quite interesting to see the different approaches you guys are using to present. We'll debate and discuss.

321
000:40:26.570 --> 000:40:32.910
Marcelo Lecocq: because we'll have possibly around 20 min left afterwards. But I think that debate and discussion will be quite.

322
000:40:33.020 --> 000:40:34.140
Marcelo Lecocq: quite rewarding.

323
000:40:35.440 --> 000:40:37.370
Marcelo Lecocq: Sherry.

324
000:40:43.320 --> 000:40:45.369
Marcelo Lecocq: do we actually in here.

325
000:40:46.990 --> 000:40:48.340
Marcelo Lecocq: or is she missing

326
000:40:51.360 --> 000:40:53.520
a feature? It's missing, isn't she?

327
000:40:56.690 --> 000:40:57.570
Marcelo Lecocq: Yes.

328
000:40:58.750 --> 000:41:00.510
Marcelo Lecocq: I can't see here in the core.

329
000:41:01.900 --> 000:41:10.229
Marcelo Lecocq: So I'm going to make the executive decision, or, please. If you could scroll Shirinka with 3, please. That'd be wonderful.

330
000:41:16.030 --> 000:41:18.930
Marcelo Lecocq: And, Blynn, if you could get ready. That would be wonderful. Please

331
000:41:33.410 --> 000:41:35.620
Marcelo Lecocq: let me know when you're ready, and

332
000:41:36.380 --> 000:41:40.150
Marcelo Lecocq: we can't hear you, though some of you might could be on mute.

333
000:41:41.190 --> 000:41:42.120
blens: Okay.

334
000:41:42.210 --> 000:41:49.599
Marcelo Lecocq: can you all see my screen? Sorry. Yes, we can see your screen, and we can see your slide right now. So ready when you are ready. Go.

335
000:41:49.600 --> 000:42:13.669
blens: So I looked at the total revenue by traffic source. So, as you all can see, Google is like Re doing really well, like as performing on high end. But the the concern area for me was this area like tick, Tock, and Yahoo and Youtube. So my recommendation is to invest more in tick, tock, and advertising companies to increase brand visibility.

336
000:42:13.670 --> 000:42:29.610
blens: I would recommend to, for example, like 50 p. 50,000 pounds towards like tick, tock, and reduce from reddit, Yahoo and Instagram. So just putting resources in different

337
000:42:29.830 --> 000:42:31.789
blens: sites. Thank you.

338
000:42:32.330 --> 000:42:33.750
Marcelo Lecocq: Thank you very much.

339
000:42:36.410 --> 000:42:39.100
Marcelo Lecocq: So if you can go on school blend, please.

340
000:42:39.310 --> 000:42:41.000
Marcelo Lecocq: whilst a Lima gets ready.

341
000:42:52.160 --> 000:42:54.349
Marcelo Lecocq: Thank you, guys. Thank you, Lima.

342
000:42:54.410 --> 000:42:56.810
Marcelo Lecocq: I'm ready to start when you ready.

343
000:42:57.810 --> 000:42:59.580
Marcelo Lecocq: You unmute your

344
000:42:59.980 --> 000:43:08.850
Marcelo Lecocq: sorry. Am I unmuted? Now you're on muted. We can hear you. Thank you very much. Can you see the screen? Okay, I don't know if it's yes, we can. You can go

345
000:43:08.930 --> 000:43:27.969
Elymma Mensah: go. Okay. So I focused on the cart to purchase conversion rate, and I found that overall for all time sales our average conversion rate from cart to purchase was 12%. However, looking at the subcategories of different clothing. This ranges from a minimum of 4% to a maximum of 18%.

346
000:43:27.990 --> 000:43:52.760
Elymma Mensah: So my recommendation is to prioritize the investment for new lines in the subcategories with the highest conversion rates. So the top 3 were ties, socks, and belts. So I would suggest or recommend that we allocate the budget for new clothing lines to the clothing lines that we see have a very high conversion rate when looking at cart to purchase conversions. That's all for me.

347
000:43:53.860 --> 000:43:55.820
Marcelo Lecocq: Brilliant. Thank you very much, Alima.

348
000:43:57.080 --> 000:44:01.270
Marcelo Lecocq: so I need to keep quiet here. Please go on to score a Lima once again.

349
000:44:01.290 --> 000:44:05.959
Marcelo Lecocq: Thus the charge supports her story. Is the narrative well delivered?

350
000:44:06.000 --> 000:44:07.700
Marcelo Lecocq: Has it got any impact?

351
000:44:14.020 --> 000:44:15.550
Marcelo Lecocq: Well, Francesca.

352
000:44:17.480 --> 000:44:20.679
Marcelo Lecocq: it's ready. Where is Francisco?

353
000:44:23.480 --> 000:44:28.070
blens: Are we missing Francisca as well? Yes, she's not. She's not here today.

354
000:44:28.140 --> 000:44:29.690
Marcelo Lecocq: Oh, alright!

355
000:44:29.710 --> 000:44:33.799
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay, never mind. So if you can, all school Francisca with threes

356
000:44:34.680 --> 000:44:40.499
Marcelo Lecocq: unless unless I make a mist, I don't have any any messages of people in the waiting room?

357
000:44:47.870 --> 000:44:50.630
Marcelo Lecocq: No, I don't have anyone in the waiting room, I think.

358
000:44:51.630 --> 000:44:53.130
Marcelo Lecocq: meaning that

359
000:44:54.340 --> 000:45:05.550
Marcelo Lecocq: this is simply not here. Okay. So next person. Francesca. So if you can score Francisco with frees sochido ready?

360
000:45:24.200 --> 000:45:25.280
Here we go.

361
000:45:25.780 --> 000:45:27.409
Marcelo Lecocq: Are you saying, can you can?

362
000:45:27.420 --> 000:45:34.319
Soichiro Tanabe: Can you? Can you hear me? Yes, we can. I think it's but you we can hear it. Time starts now.

363
000:45:35.060 --> 000:45:52.580
Soichiro Tanabe: Okay. So this year I'd like to recommend jump partition called for Christmas promotion. I find the very interesting seasonal trend last 3 months quarter for yeah over year. Revenue growth was plus 138, so successful as we can see from the line chat

364
000:45:52.580 --> 000:46:19.280
Soichiro Tanabe: compared to the previous. Yeah, there was a significant increase in revenue in particular. In November, in December of 2021. So the other chart shows top 3 up rounds and items. During this time, top 3 these 3 items and all items up from our brand prison. So this year it is expected that these items will be a plugin, so we will promote them, and we will see how it goes.

365
000:46:25.070 --> 000:46:28.440
Marcelo Lecocq: Thank you very much. Tuscido and

366
000:46:28.790 --> 000:46:35.410
Marcelo Lecocq: so can we assess this Sochido on on the delivery, on

367
000:46:35.890 --> 000:46:39.879
Marcelo Lecocq: the impact, or whether the visual supported his story

368
000:46:39.900 --> 000:46:42.849
Marcelo Lecocq: about our Christmas promotion and see some of patterns.

369
000:46:46.820 --> 000:46:50.300
Marcelo Lecocq: But Jackie's sitting. Patience he's hitting already already checked.

370
000:46:54.500 --> 000:46:59.249
No, I thought it would be a bit fiddly. Which is, it has turned out to be

371
000:47:00.160 --> 000:47:01.000
Jack C: right.

372
000:47:02.610 --> 000:47:04.540
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay, you ready to go?

373
000:47:05.110 --> 000:47:13.890
Yeah, let's go. So I decided spokes on the Kpi conversion rate. And specifically the challenge around optimising mobile conversion.

374
000:47:14.000 --> 000:47:18.020
Jack C: the mobile consistently outperforms desktop on the number of views.

375
000:47:18.370 --> 000:47:19.720
However.

376
000:47:19.770 --> 000:47:25.049
Jack C: desktop, continuous, consistently outperforms mobile on conversion rate.

377
000:47:25.100 --> 000:47:32.320
Jack C: So if we're able to to bring up the the mobile conversion rate to the the desktop right?

378
000:47:32.430 --> 000:47:51.460
Jack C: And we'll see a a significant increase in those purchases, and, as you can see on the graph on the right. This is consistent month on month throughout both of the 2 years of data. So my recommendations are, do a B testing to optimize the mobile user experience, such as streamlining the checkout process

379
000:47:51.480 --> 000:47:58.389
Jack C: and and also potentially providing some promotions and incentives for mobile users.

380
000:47:58.820 --> 000:48:00.129
Thank you.

381
000:48:00.380 --> 000:48:04.519
Marcelo Lecocq: Thank you very much, Jack. That's within 54 s.

382
000:48:06.920 --> 000:48:13.140
Marcelo Lecocq: Same drill, please. If we can go on to school. I think we've got a couple more, Melissa. No, go for a few more.

383
000:48:22.200 --> 000:48:25.720
Marcelo Lecocq: Thank you, Madisa. You you let me know when you're ready, so I can.

384
000:48:27.030 --> 000:48:28.680
Marisa Sharma: Can you hear me?

385
000:48:30.070 --> 000:48:32.470
Marisa Sharma: Yeah.

386
000:48:32.970 --> 000:48:51.610
Marisa Sharma: There's a significant opportunity to be found in promoting altar to increase prisons. North Star metric average order value overall that AV for gross transaction revenue, not including shipping across 2020 and 2020 21 is 24 pound 31, as shown by the blue, blue, black dash line

387
000:48:51.630 --> 000:48:53.310
Marisa Sharma: and visualizations.

388
000:48:53.330 --> 000:49:03.549
Marisa Sharma: Firstly, on the left. These have coupons results in increase transactions involving coupons had an AV. Of just over 14 pound greater than transactions, not involving

389
000:49:03.560 --> 000:49:14.100
Marisa Sharma: coupons, and then on the right the the outer category was linked to the highest area, approximately 19 pound greater than the standard across all categories

390
000:49:14.120 --> 000:49:19.060
Marisa Sharma: the top performing self category within auto. I was coach followed by jackets then that's

391
000:49:19.140 --> 000:49:32.110
Marisa Sharma: and therefore overall coupons and elsewhere are individually linked to an increase in AV and by combining the 2 by promoting Lsos specifically quotes, I predict an increase in prisons. More still, metric.

392
000:49:33.810 --> 000:49:38.649
Marcelo Lecocq: Thank you. Bang on time, Marisa, my my ringer, just ring run

393
000:49:39.040 --> 000:49:44.850
Marcelo Lecocq: brilliant. Can we go? Please send the school, Marisa on her impact

394
000:49:44.860 --> 000:49:48.930
Marcelo Lecocq: head. Tagline. Findings of visuals under delivery piece

395
000:49:51.100 --> 000:49:53.360
Marcelo Lecocq: whilst Marsden is getting ready?

396
000:50:04.790 --> 000:50:08.140
Marcelo Lecocq: Is this mechanism of a scoring easy for you guys?

397
000:50:09.840 --> 000:50:13.380
Marcelo Lecocq: Is there stray forward? Has it been well briefed to begin with.

398
000:50:15.330 --> 000:50:18.230
Marcelo Lecocq: cool, fantastic. So, Mars, and when you're ready.

399
000:50:18.610 --> 000:50:23.210
Marsden Falcon: Can you see my screen now? Yeah, yes, we can. Thank you. Sweet

400
000:50:23.320 --> 000:50:26.940
Marsden Falcon: I'm ready to go. Yeah, yes, go for it.

401
000:50:27.320 --> 000:50:38.870
Marsden Falcon: One of the main challenges in the fashion. Industry is creating products that have a good quality for the right price, which also make a good profit. This is why I've chosen the markup percentages my Kpi

402
000:50:39.250 --> 000:50:43.760
Marsden Falcon: to the left. There's a line line graph that shows the relationship

403
000:50:43.810 --> 000:50:50.009
Marsden Falcon: between average profit and the market. The average market value and the total profit.

404
000:50:50.190 --> 000:50:52.489
Marsden Falcon: The more market, the more

405
000:50:53.400 --> 000:50:56.699
Marsden Falcon: that better, average marker value, the more profit you make.

406
000:50:56.800 --> 000:51:11.809
Marsden Falcon: According to shopify the ideal markup percentage is about 60%, which over 8,000 items don't reach this an intern. Only over over 100,000 transactions involve such items.

407
000:51:11.850 --> 000:51:22.979
Marsden Falcon: So that's almost one in 3 going forward. I think prism shouldn't introduce items that are below the threshold of 60%. And they should phase out items that are

408
000:51:23.430 --> 000:51:29.489
Marsden Falcon: this would potentially increase profits during the during the next. So if 2 year period.

409
000:51:30.240 --> 000:51:35.169
Marcelo Lecocq: yeah, as long as it doesn't clash with, thank you very much.

410
000:51:35.590 --> 000:51:36.270
Marsden Falcon: Okay.

411
000:51:39.510 --> 000:51:44.890
Marcelo Lecocq: super. So margins. Marson introduced the concept of profit and

412
000:51:45.020 --> 000:51:52.630
Marcelo Lecocq: and margin of his present tensions. Has it been impactful that do the vicious support his story, and has it been well delivered?

413
000:51:57.880 --> 000:52:03.030
Marcelo Lecocq: Am I giving you enough time to score people? Or do we need a couple of a couple of seconds more

414
000:52:06.410 --> 000:52:07.559
Jack C: morning. It's okay.

415
000:52:07.640 --> 000:52:12.390
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay. I think that's a good timing. So Eli is next.

416
000:52:14.180 --> 000:52:17.840
Eli Azlin: yeah, just let me know when to ready go.

417
000:52:18.020 --> 000:52:27.129
Eli Azlin: Hi, so I focus on the cra and ours is exceptionally low compared to our competitors. With them reaching around 3%

418
000:52:27.590 --> 000:52:53.679
Eli Azlin:  If we look at the trend of Rtb number of clicks. It doesn't actually translate to an in any increase or trends in the number of purchases prior to July 2020, which is when which is before we worked with better. The trend of the number of clicks on Google kinda follows that of the number of purchases. However. This spike in December twenty-twenty. Can't

419
000:52:53.680 --> 000:52:58.889
Eli Azlin: does not translate to an increase in number of purchases in 2021.

420
000:52:59.050 --> 000:53:11.250
Eli Azlin: the trend in Meta and Google clicks does quite follow the number of purchases. And with Meta being our site with the highest number of clicks. So I think we should invest more in that.

421
000:53:12.560 --> 000:53:16.259
Marcelo Lecocq: Thank you very much. Eli. Bang on within the timings.

422
000:53:22.760 --> 000:53:29.280
Marcelo Lecocq: I think the next person is Saji, who who cannot make it. Unfortunately. So, if you can all score sajing a threes.

423
000:53:30.950 --> 000:53:32.990
Marcelo Lecocq: and we got Alex

424
000:53:33.350 --> 000:53:36.009
Marcelo Lecocq: the last one to go. But is Alex here?

425
000:53:37.210 --> 000:53:42.260
Marcelo Lecocq: No, so I think all. I think that you you will, submitted the thing.

426
000:53:44.080 --> 000:53:51.890
Marcelo Lecocq:  yeah, I can see now I can see the April flown in.

427
000:53:52.030 --> 000:54:02.439
Marcelo Lecocq: so 1112 should be 27 of you, submitting them great for the person. It's Michael to identify that we needed to score the th. They not shows.

428
000:54:07.120 --> 000:54:07.790
Michael: Yep.

429
000:54:08.240 --> 000:54:13.710
Marcelo Lecocq: brilliant. So I'm gonna wait until you guys? fill this.

430
000:54:29.970 --> 000:54:38.200
Marcelo Lecocq: So 23 out of 2323 out of 27. So we've got formal people to submit that.

431
000:55:01.180 --> 000:55:05.790
Marcelo Lecocq: We've still got a few people free people. If those 3 people could be submit.

432
000:55:09.240 --> 000:55:13.500
Marcelo Lecocq: I cannot see who has submitted who hasn't submitted. But if he.

433
000:55:13.570 --> 000:55:15.320
Marcelo Lecocq: if you have a look at your polls.

434
000:55:20.980 --> 000:55:29.230
Marcelo Lecocq: and whilst you doing that I'm not gonna close it yet. What's he doing that? Let me ask you a question. How was it? How was the exercise

435
000:55:30.470 --> 000:55:32.870
Marcelo Lecocq: anyone wants to voice that

436
000:55:34.070 --> 000:55:35.390
Marcelo Lecocq: their assessment

437
000:55:40.060 --> 000:55:51.080
Marcelo Lecocq: difficult? Alright, I bet you don't need you. Can. You can post things in the chat. Yes, scary Marisa. Well d10'kay. Anybody else

438
000:55:52.170 --> 000:55:53.220
Marcelo Lecocq: hairful.

439
000:55:58.510 --> 000:56:04.539
Marcelo Lecocq: intimidating, right! These are all well. Words of

440
000:56:04.710 --> 000:56:18.680
Marcelo Lecocq: it feels something you tell me when you have to present to a wider audience, right when you're unsure of what you're presenting is correct, or what you know, what you don't really know whether how the audience is going to behave.

441
000:56:19.760 --> 000:56:23.070
Marcelo Lecocq: So I feel the same in my career. I've always

442
000:56:23.310 --> 000:56:26.150
Marcelo Lecocq: Oh, sorry, Jack, you want to have a go. And you

443
000:56:28.080 --> 000:56:30.210
Jack C: yeah, I was just gonna

444
000:56:30.600 --> 000:56:35.609
Jack C: say it felt better the second time round from doing it the other day.

445
000:56:35.770 --> 000:56:36.790
and

446
000:56:36.840 --> 000:56:42.649
Jack C: just like the very small pieces of feedback that we got like during the interview.

447
000:56:42.810 --> 000:56:45.839
Jack C: like we're really helpful to take on board.

448
000:56:45.910 --> 000:56:48.119
Jack C: And I think just like another reflection is

449
000:56:49.470 --> 000:56:59.020
people's like some people saying how like intimidating scary is like it really didn't come across. I didn't get sent from anyone that they were like nervous or scared.

450
000:56:59.240 --> 000:57:08.049
Jack C: so it didn't like come through their presentation, or, say, might have been feeling it. I wouldn't have picked out someone that was like particularly nervous compared to others. So

451
000:57:08.640 --> 000:57:21.969
Marcelo Lecocq: yeah, be kind on ourselves. Maybe I think you should be really proud of yourself. I didn't notice any level of nervousness at all. Okay, so so well done. And and I'm hoping that you guys prepare in advance

452
000:57:22.230 --> 000:57:41.459
Marcelo Lecocq: because the secret of facing these demons of uncertainty or you don't know how it's gonna go is preparation preparation. Preparation. Okay? 1. One of the things I miss, however, that we're gonna worked really hard in the next few weeks with you guys with the other coaches is the headline.

453
000:57:41.860 --> 000:57:42.710
Marcelo Lecocq: okay.

454
000:57:43.150 --> 000:57:52.330
Marcelo Lecocq: what? I didn't see a single headline that make me think, okay, I'm sold. I don't need to read anything else. The rest almost doesn't matter.

455
000:57:52.540 --> 000:57:54.080
Marcelo Lecocq: The headline says it all.

456
000:57:54.250 --> 000:57:57.569
Marcelo Lecocq: I didn't see a single headline that says,

457
000:57:58.060 --> 000:58:04.970
Marcelo Lecocq: Google, outperforms every single other vendor by 25%

458
000:58:05.400 --> 000:58:06.690
Marcelo Lecocq: investing gold.

459
000:58:06.990 --> 000:58:23.109
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay, I didn't see anything like environment important. A prism should should follow environmental credentials by doing so and so. And so, okay, I missed that powerful connection of the story. I think the Charles were brilliant overall.

460
000:58:23.180 --> 000:58:31.590
Marcelo Lecocq: and the recommendations overall were pretty decent, right? So there was a link between the recommendations and the and the and the visuals.

461
000:58:31.730 --> 000:58:34.230
Marcelo Lecocq: But I miss that headline.

462
000:58:34.350 --> 000:58:40.339
Marcelo Lecocq: Let me think about when you read the newspapers. What makes you read the story inside the newspaper.

463
000:58:43.650 --> 000:58:50.060
Marcelo Lecocq: What drives you as users as individuals. to read more. to want it, to understand more

464
000:58:50.520 --> 000:58:54.129
Marsden Falcon: headline in a newspaper. Okay?

465
000:58:54.710 --> 000:59:06.670
Marcelo Lecocq: And when you go a a any of you read books like good old fashioned paper books. No kindle anything. Any of you read books like the Lord of the Rings, so his dog materials, or

466
000:59:06.680 --> 000:59:08.409
Marcelo Lecocq: or something more modern.

467
000:59:09.700 --> 000:59:11.359
Marcelo Lecocq: At the back of each book

468
000:59:11.740 --> 000:59:17.359
Marcelo Lecocq: there is a little phrase, best book I've read in the next

469
000:59:17.400 --> 000:59:19.339
Marcelo Lecocq: in the last 20 years

470
000:59:19.470 --> 000:59:26.030
Marcelo Lecocq: inspiring, thrilling, and the name of the person that has written the phrase.

471
000:59:26.350 --> 000:59:28.850
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay, that's a mechanism

472
000:59:28.920 --> 000:59:36.910
Marcelo Lecocq: to make you read the book. Okay? Well, if I'm not going to read 500 pages, but so and so says Good. Right? Well, he's my idol.

473
000:59:37.460 --> 000:59:51.019
Marcelo Lecocq: So the tagline, the headline says it all summarizes the whole of the book idea or summarizes the whole of the story in one little phrase, okay, and that's something we're gonna need to work with. You really hard in the next few weeks?

474
000:59:51.500 --> 000:59:56.860
Marcelo Lecocq: Let me stop there for a second and check for more feedback from you guys. And how this exercise go?

475
001:00:02.600 --> 001:00:05.220
Marcelo Lecocq: Do you agree with what I'm saying around the headline?

476
001:00:06.880 --> 001:00:07.570
Marcelo Lecocq: Yep.

477
001:00:08.640 --> 001:00:12.409
Marcelo Lecocq: And it's really, really important. It's really, really important blends. Please go ahead.

478
001:00:12.890 --> 001:00:19.290
blens: Is that like the same thing. Does that the punchline like how you come in with the message?

479
001:00:19.570 --> 001:00:24.580
Marcelo Lecocq: Exactly. The the headline, the headline should be what describes the whole story?

480
001:00:24.700 --> 001:00:31.370
Marcelo Lecocq: Ok. And it's an art. And it's an art that you have developed over time. None of us are journalists but us, a journalism

481
001:00:31.440 --> 001:00:49.509
Marcelo Lecocq: elements that you're gonna have to develop in your careers. Okay? And you realize it's going to be super beneficial for your for your job, hunt for your interviews, but also for your personal achievements. When you write something you can describe in a words a huge slide

482
001:00:50.090 --> 001:00:51.370
Marcelo Lecocq: at pizza.

483
001:00:51.850 --> 001:00:57.810
Peter Shatwell:  yeah, I saw I'm just trying to distinguish between like

484
001:00:58.180 --> 001:01:04.119
Peter Shatwell: an insight and a recommendation. Because,

485
001:01:04.470 --> 001:01:14.050
Peter Shatwell: I think for a headline I can see having an insight as a headline being punchy and powerful, maybe, like, you know, this is the finding

486
001:01:14.240 --> 001:01:21.149
Peter Shatwell: that can grab someone's attention, whereas, like recommendation is a headline which is what I went with like, I think

487
001:01:21.410 --> 001:01:23.500
Peter Shatwell: it's you. You can't really.

488
001:01:23.530 --> 001:01:34.799
Peter Shatwell: that that needs to be precise and like like a call to action like this is what you should do. But no. Should the headline maybe combine the 2 things like an insight and a and a call to action?

489
001:01:35.030 --> 001:01:38.960
Peter Shatwell:  I think the mix of both is critical.

490
001:01:38.970 --> 001:02:00.919
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay, so nobody's gonna read your slides if they don't, if they don't get grabbed by the headline, okay? And sometimes you have to exaggerate. And this is something we're gonna learn in storytelling. You have to excite, exaggerate, like, if you don't do this, we all gonna die double thing. Okay, if you don't read this one you're gonna be left out.

491
001:02:00.970 --> 001:02:08.199
Marcelo Lecocq: or this is extremely important for profits. Or if you don't sell XY. Zed, we're all going to go in the red.

492
001:02:08.500 --> 001:02:16.899
Marcelo Lecocq: I think both of those things. Go hand in hand. You need to sell. This is a cells mechanism of self selling your analytics.

493
001:02:17.560 --> 001:02:20.440
Peter Shatwell: Umhm. Thanks, no, that's helpful. Alright.

494
001:02:21.650 --> 001:02:30.849
Marcelo Lecocq: But, by the way, I love the idea that you touch on environmental concerns, that there were a few, a few of you. Personally, I think they're magic.

495
001:02:31.050 --> 001:02:32.470
Marcelo Lecocq: You took a benchmark.

496
001:02:32.700 --> 001:02:48.350
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay, when you provide someone with a benchmark that you see their internal or external, they call oh, something I can compare with right? I think 2, 3, or 4 people, are you? They looked into when we look at the benchmark, we definitely not doing very well. Okay.

497
001:02:48.680 --> 001:02:58.930
Marcelo Lecocq: and I love that. But I love the idea of of getting what you did. I think you were one of the only ones. If I'm not mistaken, Peter, that you use the environment as a grubber.

498
001:02:59.110 --> 001:03:06.880
Marcelo Lecocq: And I would I've would have abused, not because it is is great to talk about environment right? I would have abused it because it's every in everybody's mind.

499
001:03:07.620 --> 001:03:12.539
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay, you would have captivated with a headline if you linked it with something environmental.

500
001:03:15.410 --> 001:03:21.560
Marcelo Lecocq: Sorry, Lima, go ahead. I think maybe for me I don't know if it was everyone else, but I wasn't clear on what the headline

501
001:03:21.580 --> 001:03:51.369
Elymma Mensah: should get across, and I wasn't sure how much of it was supposed to be in like the grass. I didn't. Maybe I didn't read the the the message from, but I didn't know that the headline was allowed to just say everything. I think I'm used to having the headline be an introduction, and then I explain in a day. So in afterwards. But I wasn't. I guess I know, going forward that now it's okay to like, actually put the end thing like first, like the main thing first and then explain it.

502
001:03:51.460 --> 001:03:58.439
Elymma Mensah: And it's not like a jump to put the main like recommendation and the stats right in the beginning, like it doesn't

503
001:03:58.660 --> 001:04:00.020
Elymma Mensah: cause. I think

504
001:04:00.080 --> 001:04:09.690
Elymma Mensah: maybe the way I used to do things. Maybe in union, that doing that would be like, Oh, why are you jumping straight to the end. Why are you jumping straight to the results like talk us through in like a

505
001:04:09.930 --> 001:04:19.280
Elymma Mensah: like like that? But I guess that's more of a report style thing instead of like a presentation for like making a recommendation. So something that's valuable for me to learn from this. Yeah.

506
001:04:19.360 --> 001:04:21.320
Marcelo Lecocq: I think there's a format for

507
001:04:21.370 --> 001:04:29.329
Marcelo Lecocq: the context. Whether you mention the educational context, you have to follow something called the Romans style of presentation or writing.

508
001:04:29.530 --> 001:04:36.959
Marcelo Lecocq: And there's 2 2 ways of presenting the Romans and the Greeks, and I'd have learned this from A from from a barrister.

509
001:04:36.980 --> 001:04:38.080
Marcelo Lecocq: from a lawyer.

510
001:04:38.370 --> 001:04:48.339
Marcelo Lecocq: The the Romans start with developing the story they take you through a lovely narrative, and they deliver the message at the end.

511
001:04:48.400 --> 001:04:53.830
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay. and it's great. If you've got plenty of time to listen to that the Greeks

512
001:04:53.950 --> 001:05:10.180
Marcelo Lecocq: they throw the punch line, and only if you're interested they develop the the story afterwards. Okay. in most present day, most things you're gonna be facing in the future careers with very high demanding jobs and managers. You have to use the rink.

513
001:05:10.340 --> 001:05:25.889
Marcelo Lecocq: deliver the punchline, make them interested, then develop the story. Okay? And I think that's something that I'm gonna take on board here and talk to the other coaches to, to to generate, some, content to to help you with those headlines. Okay?

514
001:05:26.390 --> 001:05:36.270
Marcelo Lecocq: Makes sense. Do do you agree that you'll be more interested if you were a CEO, you only leave the content that goes underneath. If you were persuaded by the the headline.

515
001:05:37.110 --> 001:05:41.849
Marcelo Lecocq: so do you think that we should be seeing my finger on my own here?

516
001:05:42.990 --> 001:05:51.680
Elymma Mensah: Do you think there'll be beneficial for all of you to work on headline production.

517
001:05:52.910 --> 001:05:57.229
Marcelo Lecocq: How about Florina? See you nodding. You think we should do it, Rami?

518
001:05:57.520 --> 001:06:00.669
Florine: Yeah, I think I agree. II think I had the same

519
001:06:00.810 --> 001:06:05.319
Florine: problem when I was writing the headline, I just wasn't really sure what to

520
001:06:05.670 --> 001:06:08.319
Florine: what to put there. So yeah, for me, it would be useful.

521
001:06:09.560 --> 001:06:12.160
Marcelo Lecocq: Fantastic. Juliet. you're there.

522
001:06:13.590 --> 001:06:24.559
juliette amauger: Yeah. Yeah. Same, II was gonna say, like, like, coming from a scientific background. We usually keep the conclusion to the end.

523
001:06:24.770 --> 001:06:30.210
juliette amauger: So yeah, it was really interesting to like, know how to do it

524
001:06:30.360 --> 001:06:31.660
juliette amauger: as a headline.

525
001:06:32.150 --> 001:06:33.840
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay, Michael.

526
001:06:35.220 --> 001:06:40.740
Michael: Yes, for me, I understand the importance of the of the headline of Deliver. I'm more concerned with the

527
001:06:41.440 --> 001:06:46.400
Michael:  with the insight that would motivate the strong advice.

528
001:06:46.480 --> 001:06:47.490
But that problem.

529
001:06:47.530 --> 001:06:49.890
Michael: personally less confident about

530
001:06:50.840 --> 001:07:12.960
Marcelo Lecocq: don't take me wrong. You need the insights. The headline is ch. How you package that insight or the recommendation. Okay? But you need that foundation analysis. First, I mean, th, the headlines not gonna replace the the hard work analytics underneath.

531
001:07:13.730 --> 001:07:20.440
Michael: But but we should switch. I mean, I would worry about the inside and then the

532
001:07:20.730 --> 001:07:25.600
Michael: but then, obviously, I think there are 2 different type of skills. I guess

533
001:07:26.430 --> 001:07:47.490
Marcelo Lecocq: the exactly. So the headline is more of an odd is the journalism thing. You developed over time around the storytelling, and and II think, mentioned twice or 3 times and week, 8 or week 9 this whole week on on telling story. Okay? But I'm gonna make sure that we put something on headlines in there, right, or we work with you individually, so you can amaze your audience.

534
001:07:50.030 --> 001:07:53.050
Marcelo Lecocq: I've got one more person that needs to submit their

535
001:07:53.440 --> 001:07:59.110
Marcelo Lecocq: I and I don't think that's me, cause II if anybody, can have a look at their

536
001:07:59.770 --> 001:08:05.739
Marcelo Lecocq: the pause. and whether they submit it or not, because I'm going to end it right now.

537
001:08:07.480 --> 001:08:08.900
Marcelo Lecocq: One last chance.

538
001:08:10.270 --> 001:08:14.100
Marcelo Lecocq: Anyone wants to look at the polls, whether they're submitted or not.

539
001:08:16.720 --> 001:08:19.640
Marcelo Lecocq: or perhaps some of the join in the left. No.

540
001:08:19.920 --> 001:08:22.020
wouldn't appear. So I'm going to close the pool.

541
001:08:23.229 --> 001:08:24.270
Marisa Sharma: One person

542
001:08:24.470 --> 001:08:27.609
Marisa Sharma: I think it might be, Sergeant, because he had to leave, maybe.

543
001:08:27.649 --> 001:08:29.709
Marcelo Lecocq: Oh, he joined, and he then he left.

544
001:08:29.960 --> 001:08:31.689
Marisa Sharma: Yeah. Well, okay.

545
001:08:31.800 --> 001:08:33.279
Marcelo Lecocq: possibly end pull.

546
001:08:35.300 --> 001:08:38.800
Marcelo Lecocq: And then I'm going to save the resource download resource

547
001:08:44.680 --> 001:08:51.380
Marcelo Lecocq: and download resource. And Csv, why is it doing? Csv, and I'm gonna stop recording Brian. Now.
