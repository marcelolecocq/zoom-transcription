1
000:00:00.000 --> 000:00:06.249
Harry Odell:  easy, lady. Cool. Good morning. Alright. So today

2
000:00:06.590 --> 000:00:10.360
Harry Odell: we don't have a title for the little stand up.

3
000:00:10.460 --> 000:00:13.070
Harry Odell: We just gonna talk about some.

4
000:00:13.080 --> 000:00:27.390
Harry Odell: at least to me, semi interesting data problem. So I'm gonna get your thoughts on a couple of them. And then at the end we'll see what the take away might be. And I'm gonna let you guys

5
000:00:27.490 --> 000:00:39.319
Harry Odell: dictate and lead on that. So it does require a little bit of input from your end. So just play along, and hopefully we shall get somewhere.

6
000:00:40.940 --> 000:00:42.679
Harry Odell: and there are some slides

7
000:00:45.710 --> 000:00:48.800
Harry Odell: which hopefully you can see

8
000:00:51.340 --> 000:00:55.180
Harry Odell: cool. I've got a couple nods all right blank sides.

9
000:00:55.700 --> 000:01:21.030
Harry Odell: Cool. My tree groups. I'm sorry, guys. You're counted out of this first one, at least. So for the rest of you, we're looking at a plane, and I like to tease this one out. And my tree groups have already have already seen this one. So I'm gonna skip through pretty quickly. Just because we've got a few examples to get through. Alright, we have a plane, it has dots on. What are we looking at?

10
000:01:23.810 --> 000:01:26.060
Harry Odell: Come on suggestions. Let's go.

11
000:01:26.830 --> 000:01:30.960
These are the net holes of a plane during the war.

12
000:01:31.080 --> 000:01:46.610
Harry Odell: You've seen it before, Jack. Then no spoilers. Cool, alright bullet holes exactly. That's right. Well, well, too. We have this data set. We've got bullet holes in our planes.

13
000:01:46.810 --> 000:01:51.369
Harry Odell: We want to make our planes better. We want to look after our soldiers.

14
000:01:51.960 --> 000:01:59.229
Harry Odell: What do we do with our with our data set here thinking about the planes, the wackiness suggestions? The better let's go.

15
000:02:08.080 --> 000:02:16.060
Eli Azlin: Would you reinforce those specific areas would like different material. So but it's don't

16
000:02:16.570 --> 000:02:17.819
Eli Azlin: damage as much.

17
000:02:18.410 --> 000:02:19.819
Harry Odell: We can add armour.

18
000:02:21.280 --> 000:02:22.699
Harry Odell: What else can we do?

19
000:02:28.800 --> 000:02:33.560
Maybe make those areas harder to hit like skinnier. I don't know.

20
000:02:34.230 --> 000:02:39.390
Harry Odell: We can make the areas harder to hit. We can make the wings smaller. Maybe, Rob, I don't know

21
000:02:41.640 --> 000:02:43.309
Harry Odell: what else might we want to do.

22
000:03:05.670 --> 000:03:08.150
Harry Odell: Month PA.

23
000:03:08.360 --> 000:03:11.750
Harry Odell: Kelly Owen. Ernest. Ideas! Let's go

24
000:03:13.840 --> 000:03:15.749
Harry Odell: cheery. I can see you smiling.

25
000:03:20.070 --> 000:03:25.900
Peter Shatwell: but I I'm I'm staying quiet, cause II know where this is going as well like like Jack.

26
000:03:26.400 --> 000:03:30.659
Peter Shatwell: Alright, then then help us out. I guess it's just like thinking about

27
000:03:30.840 --> 000:03:42.200
Peter Shatwell: how have we? How have we got this data?  yeah. Cause this is a plane that's been in the war and has come back to us. And we're now looking at it.

28
000:03:45.830 --> 000:03:49.639
Harry Odell: Pete is by and gone. So what? What do we take away from that? What Pete has just said.

29
000:03:58.460 --> 000:04:03.860
Harry Odell: okay, conscious of time, let me rephrase that. This is our data set.

30
000:04:06.390 --> 000:04:09.570
Harry Odell: What are we missing from this picture?

31
000:04:12.220 --> 000:04:17.159
robmadigan: Maybe we're missing numbers here like actual like counting all the

32
000:04:17.329 --> 000:04:19.300
different individual darts or something.

33
000:04:19.839 --> 000:04:23.849
robmadigan: Not sure. So these planes are in the war, right? They're fighting.

34
000:04:24.700 --> 000:04:31.880
Harry Odell: We're imagining we've got these plates back because we can see the data. So what are we missing

35
000:04:32.100 --> 000:04:32.980
Harry Odell: Cherry?

36
000:04:34.060 --> 000:04:36.770
Shiri: This is gonna sound really dumb. But the pilot made it back.

37
000:04:37.360 --> 000:04:38.180
Harry Odell: Yeah.

38
000:04:38.760 --> 000:04:44.979
Shiri: So the people on the plane and where they were located.

39
000:04:45.970 --> 000:04:52.500
Harry Odell: Oh, the first it was Ryan.

40
000:04:52.690 --> 000:04:56.179
Harry Odell: These planes made it back. So what are we missing?

41
000:04:56.880 --> 000:04:58.209
Eli Azlin: The ones that didn't.

42
000:04:58.500 --> 000:05:02.030
Harry Odell: the ones that didn't? Where did the ones that didn't get shot

43
000:05:08.360 --> 000:05:09.800
Andrei Espenilla: where the pilot's in.

44
000:05:10.600 --> 000:05:13.399
Harry Odell: When a pilot's sitting. Okay, where else?

45
000:05:16.150 --> 000:05:20.329
Shiri: The areas that are like white and not dotted.

46
000:05:20.430 --> 000:05:22.990
Harry Odell: basically the blind carrier. So

47
000:05:23.120 --> 000:05:34.039
Harry Odell: these any areas here that really interesting to us these are where, if you get shot, you ain't coming home. So we're looking at this now, and perhaps

48
000:05:34.130 --> 000:05:38.239
Harry Odell: Rob said. Can't remember about said, we want to protect these red dots.

49
000:05:38.400 --> 000:05:46.120
Harry Odell: Actually, that's wrong. This is what we call survivorship bias. These are the planes that return back. And so we need to flip the script a little bit.

50
000:05:46.840 --> 000:05:50.039
Harry Odell: Focus on the white areas here.

51
000:05:50.070 --> 000:05:53.070
Harry Odell: So that's example number one.

52
000:05:54.050 --> 000:05:55.660
Harry Odell: example number 2,

53
000:05:57.080 --> 000:05:59.949
Harry Odell: ice cream sales.

54
000:06:03.650 --> 000:06:08.069
Harry Odell: What are we looking at? What? What do we not want to do with our ice creams?

55
000:06:13.260 --> 000:06:19.879
robmadigan: Isn't that like example of causation? Isn't. The correlation is neat with the causation.

56
000:06:21.120 --> 000:06:25.800
robmadigan: Yeah. So what what's going on? Then? They're kind of like trying to

57
000:06:26.290 --> 000:06:32.260
robmadigan: find a relationship between 2 totally independent sports factors.

58
000:06:32.290 --> 000:06:41.059
whereas, like increase of let's look at their one on the right increase of ice creams related to increase chart. This. like where to has the relationship with that kind of.

59
000:06:41.710 --> 000:06:54.180
robmadigan: But obviously I don't know as the months go on. I guess that's that's what they're trying to get at. Aim at trying to say that both increase as the months go on. Well, obviously, they're unrelated to each other.

60
000:06:55.580 --> 000:06:56.460
So yeah.

61
000:06:57.070 --> 000:06:57.930
Harry Odell: yeah.

62
000:06:58.280 --> 000:07:01.240
Harry Odell: time off. Does anyone want to flesh out

63
000:07:02.470 --> 000:07:03.930
Harry Odell: Rob's argument there.

64
000:07:06.970 --> 000:07:23.329
Peter Shatwell: Oh, okay, sure. I mean, yeah. I guess what you don't want to do is just that there's a causal relationship between. The variables like ice cream sold and shark attacks or ice cream sold and murder rate.

65
000:07:23.350 --> 000:07:34.500
Peter Shatwell:  but like. I know, there is a relationship between the 2. But you have to think I don't know what else might be driving that. And and typically it's

66
000:07:34.510 --> 000:07:38.010
Peter Shatwell: like a third variable that might

67
000:07:38.200 --> 000:07:45.219
Peter Shatwell: contribute to both in a similar way which leads to that kind of correlation. But that's just a suggestion.

68
000:07:45.840 --> 000:07:50.190
Harry Odell: Sounds good to me. Give me that third variable on the right hand side.

69
000:07:51.720 --> 000:07:52.610
Harry Odell: Alex.

70
000:07:53.380 --> 000:08:01.340
Alex Yelland: Shark attacks will probably happen around the beach sort of area which people go to in the summer, which is when people will also be buying ice creams.

71
000:08:02.590 --> 000:08:22.040
Harry Odell: Cool. Yeah, sunnier it is, the more people buy ice creams, the more people go swimming in the sea, and the more shark attacks around. So that's the common thread there. We might in this case basically say, stop selling ice creams, and people might not get attacked by sharks. But that's not what we want to do. Okay, take the left side. Then

72
000:08:22.210 --> 000:08:29.460
Harry Odell: ice creams and murderate in New York City. Someone tell me what's going on there open to wacky suggestions. Again.

73
000:08:36.640 --> 000:08:37.679
Harry Odell: Victoria.

74
000:08:39.240 --> 000:08:43.460
Victoria Sanders: It could be the summer again. There are more ice creams sold.

75
000:08:43.620 --> 000:08:54.510
Victoria Sanders: you know. over in the summer again, and people are also hot and nasty and grumpy in the summer, so there are times where ice cream sold and murder rates are higher

76
000:08:54.730 --> 000:09:00.640
Victoria Sanders: is, especially in New York. It's disgusting in the summer, so people will kill people

77
000:09:01.100 --> 000:09:05.809
Harry Odell: I love love that I've been in. I lived in New York for a few years, was there in the summer.

78
000:09:05.840 --> 000:09:10.420
Harry Odell: I didn't kill anyone. But I did get a bit. Iggy. Marsden.

79
000:09:11.420 --> 000:09:20.089
Marsden Falcon: yeah. Just basically what? Victoria says. maybe there's more people out in the streets, drinking and stuff and whatnot hanging around. So

80
000:09:20.260 --> 000:09:22.620
Marsden Falcon: more people shoot each other, however.

81
000:09:23.170 --> 000:09:26.000
Harry Odell: Oh, alcohol, fuel, fuel! Murders

82
000:09:26.340 --> 000:09:29.420
Harry Odell: interested! There was a couple hands. There, did we have

83
000:09:30.190 --> 000:09:32.620
did you steal your answers? Basically.

84
000:09:33.480 --> 000:09:34.820
Harry Odell: was it, Alex?

85
000:09:36.090 --> 000:09:50.919
Alex Kononov: Yes, basically. My approach was the same as Marsden's. I mean, people, yeah, tend to spend more time outside in summer, which means they just have this longer

86
000:09:50.980 --> 000:09:55.309
Alex Kononov: period within which they can be attacked

87
000:09:55.470 --> 000:10:10.029
Alex Kononov: for any and every reason. And the same goes for the summer time when people tends to consume alcohol and drugs outside, etc., etc. So

88
000:10:10.150 --> 000:10:12.539
Alex Kononov: yeah, basically, all of them together.

89
000:10:13.190 --> 000:10:24.049
Harry Odell: Cool. Yeah, I think they're all valid answers. I actually don't know what's driving this I'd probably say the same as you guys. But what we might infer just looking at the data itself

90
000:10:24.090 --> 000:10:32.650
Harry Odell: is that thinking X is our independent? The more you murder or more murder there are the more ice creams you gonna sell. So

91
000:10:33.230 --> 000:10:37.270
Harry Odell: that's the takeaway. That's what the data is telling us. There.

92
000:10:38.460 --> 000:10:43.469
Harry Odell: cool. That's an example. Number 2, example number 3. Now this is going to take

93
000:10:44.090 --> 000:10:50.470
Harry Odell: a wee explanation and a little bit of thought. Now let's imagine we are in a city.

94
000:10:50.830 --> 000:10:54.510
Harry Odell: There are 2 taxi companies in Set City.

95
000:10:54.610 --> 000:10:58.080
Harry Odell: a blue taxi and a Green Taxi company now

96
000:10:58.170 --> 000:11:07.690
Harry Odell: nicely all in the Blue taxi com. All the taxes in the Blue Tax Company are blue and the green taxes are green. And this is the distribution. So there's 90%

97
000:11:07.840 --> 000:11:17.880
Harry Odell: of the taxi to blue and 10% agree. There has been a hit and drug. Somebody got run over and we have one witness.

98
000:11:18.320 --> 000:11:20.150
Harry Odell: The witness says.

99
000:11:20.360 --> 000:11:25.230
Harry Odell: They saw a green taxi. Now, what the

100
000:11:25.690 --> 000:11:40.780
Harry Odell: authorities did them was test this person's eyesight in the dark, which was when that this hit and run happened, and they said that in both instances, for both green and blue taxis, they were able to identify

101
000:11:41.220 --> 000:11:49.679
Harry Odell: and correctly, 80% of the time. So this person saying, it's a green taxi that did it and given the data, we know that

102
000:11:49.770 --> 000:11:53.089
Harry Odell: in 80%. And the cases for both sets of tuxes

103
000:11:53.540 --> 000:11:57.620
Harry Odell: they get it right? That amount of time. It's 8%.

104
000:11:57.630 --> 000:12:00.510
Harry Odell: So what do we conclude from

105
000:12:01.270 --> 000:12:06.699
Harry Odell: our little investigation? The person saying, it's green. Are we happy with that?

106
000:12:17.440 --> 000:12:21.300
Harry Odell: Anybody else want to jump in before I come to Alex.

107
000:12:26.980 --> 000:12:32.400
Harry Odell: The person saying is green. Do we trust them? They get it right. 80% of the time

108
000:12:36.630 --> 000:12:38.070
Harry Odell: go on, Peter.

109
000:12:38.770 --> 000:12:43.859
Peter Shatwell:  well, yeah, I guess it's a strong data point that like

110
000:12:43.960 --> 000:12:47.199
Peter Shatwell: you get it right? 80% of the time. But this is

111
000:12:47.700 --> 000:12:59.790
Peter Shatwell: given. They've seen a green taxi. So But it's it's unlikely that they saw a green taxi. In the first place, as as there's only 10%. 10%. Of them are green.

112
000:12:59.900 --> 000:13:06.799
Peter Shatwell: So I think I don't know it. I think it's still more likely that they see a blue one.

113
000:13:08.130 --> 000:13:09.630
Harry Odell: coat, doctor.

114
000:13:12.110 --> 000:13:18.149
Jack C: Yeah, I was thinking about like during the during the test. How is it the same split of

115
000:13:19.070 --> 000:13:20.830
Jack C: blue and green taxis?

116
000:13:22.960 --> 000:13:32.379
Jack C: So they saw. Let's say they tested it with a hundred green, a hundred blue, and in 8%. Of those cases for both colors, the person got it right.

117
000:13:32.840 --> 000:13:38.150
Jack C: Oh, yeah, I trust him. Then you trust him. Yeah. cool. Alex.

118
000:13:39.270 --> 000:13:56.549
Alex Kononov: I have 2 considerations here. First one is the fact that in this situation we are looking in this particular context, we are looking in reverse on the problem. I mean, they are not 80% right. They are 20% wrong.

119
000:13:56.840 --> 000:14:13.480
Alex Kononov: Because when it comes to thing that can lead to somebody spending a lot of time in jail. And I think that's up to Covid underneath. Everybody understands very well what it means for a person's well being. It's quite a serious thing. And

120
000:14:13.590 --> 000:14:34.690
Alex Kononov: having 20% error, possibilities a bit too much, and also in majority of countries, the judgements is made when the guilt is proven, be beyond a reasonable doubt. So I think 20% is

121
000:14:34.940 --> 000:14:45.050
Alex Kononov: much higher than reasonable doubt. And I can understand that of course, there are only 10% of green taxes. But this is actually also.

122
000:14:45.210 --> 000:14:48.060
Alex Kononov: from my points of view, an amplifying factor

123
000:14:48.290 --> 000:14:58.790
Alex Kononov: in this case. Because we have a 20% margin for to 10% of the cars.

124
000:14:59.030 --> 000:15:00.690
Alex Kononov: So yeah.

125
000:15:00.960 --> 000:15:07.470
Harry Odell: okay, so it's it is uncertain. And see there, no matter what. And we got a little bit

126
000:15:07.700 --> 000:15:15.070
Harry Odell: side transport. If if we're in the call, we want to be absolutely certain. Okay, a fair point. And Jack, did you want to comment? Or.

127
000:15:16.500 --> 000:15:18.189
yeah, I was just thinking

128
000:15:18.470 --> 000:15:19.530
Jack C: like it.

129
000:15:20.270 --> 000:15:33.119
Jack C: Say, there's a hundred 1,000 taxi to something like it's a pretty good start to look at. Like if you're 80% certain. it's better than nothing. I don't think you're

130
000:15:34.800 --> 000:15:37.029
yeah. I'd I'd put my hand outside immediately.

131
000:15:37.060 --> 000:15:46.650
Jack C: It was a bit of a it was an accident, but that's kind of what I'm thinking is, it's like, it's a pretty good good start. 80%

132
000:15:47.040 --> 000:15:52.240
Harry Odell: point in the finger someone. But it's a starting point.

133
000:15:52.290 --> 000:15:53.380
Jack C: Okay.

134
000:15:54.430 --> 000:16:00.999
Harry Odell: okay, cool. So we can actually see that as Pete, I was alluding to

135
000:16:01.680 --> 000:16:09.460
Harry Odell: the breakdown of what might happen. And we can do this through dates. So this is what we call base rate policy. Now.

136
000:16:09.550 --> 000:16:14.800
Harry Odell: we've got some evidence here, and that's the person telling us they seen a green taxi.

137
000:16:15.080 --> 000:16:32.740
Harry Odell: What we tend to do at that point is focus in on what we've just come across. So we've just come across this person telling us it's green. And what we then do is kind of ignore the context. In that 90% of taxes in the city are blue.

138
000:16:33.010 --> 000:16:45.039
Harry Odell: That's what Peter was saying. And next slide here, this is what the breakdown is. So if we look at this, we've got blue taxis and we have green taxis.

139
000:16:45.870 --> 000:16:47.899
Harry Odell: There's 90 blue taxis.

140
000:16:47.940 --> 000:16:55.000
Harry Odell: The person I could identify them correctly, 8% at a time, which gives us 72 taxes

141
000:16:55.950 --> 000:17:15.669
Harry Odell: in the cases they were wrong. That's the 18 here, and vice versa. So what we're actually saying here is that if the person guessed or a person guessed person said it was a green taxi of those 10 taxis, they're gonna be right 8 at the time. Therefore we've got 8 taxis correctly identified.

142
000:17:16.130 --> 000:17:18.320
Harry Odell: If we look at the flip side of that.

143
000:17:18.520 --> 000:17:22.159
Harry Odell: the ones where they said it was bloop.

144
000:17:22.550 --> 000:17:40.030
Harry Odell: Sorry it it was green, and it was actually blue. This is these 18 here. So what we're saying is, actually, if the person guessed a blue taxi incorrectly. That's 18 or green taxi correctly. That's 8. So it's more likely to be

145
000:17:40.190 --> 000:17:50.400
Harry Odell: a blue taxi. But they said it was green rather than actually a green taxi there. So the data in this case is telling us that

146
000:17:50.700 --> 000:17:59.969
Harry Odell: pretty much. Go with a blue toxie and ignore what this person's telling us. So this is the breakdown here, and this is

147
000:18:00.060 --> 000:18:13.919
Harry Odell: for anyone that's done. Stats sort of the basis of Bayes theorem. Here the data is telling us ignore what this person's saying. Yes, it was a blue taxi. And you're going to be right more often than not.

148
000:18:14.680 --> 000:18:22.300
Harry Odell: So that's example number 3. And last example. Here. For the football funds amongst us.

149
000:18:23.550 --> 000:18:25.400
Harry Odell: Who do we want in our team?

150
000:18:29.160 --> 000:18:30.840
Harry Odell: Just realise this is

151
000:18:32.840 --> 000:18:36.670
Harry Odell: stolen from the sun. We don't like that.

152
000:18:40.280 --> 000:18:44.469
Harry Odell: But yeah, discuss. Do we want Ronaldo, or do we want Messi

153
000:18:58.070 --> 000:18:58.890
Harry Odell: Mawson

154
000:18:59.420 --> 000:19:02.029
Marsden Falcon: just based on those stats?

155
000:19:02.080 --> 000:19:03.959
Marsden Falcon: Be messy, wouldn't that? But

156
000:19:05.560 --> 000:19:15.300
Marsden Falcon: I've argued, I prefer Ronaldo, and this is outside knowledge or so, judging, judging on them stats, I'd say it'd be it'd be messy. No.

157
000:19:17.700 --> 000:19:18.610
Harry Odell: alright.

158
000:19:20.560 --> 000:19:23.999
Florine: yeah, I was thinking the same thing because I thought his

159
000:19:24.520 --> 000:19:29.350
Florine: club goals per game are higher than Ronaldo. and you play more

160
000:19:29.430 --> 000:19:33.129
Florine: club games and international games. So that's why I thought messy

161
000:19:35.940 --> 000:19:39.769
Harry Odell: anyone else in the Ronaldo Messi debate

162
000:19:43.280 --> 000:19:44.160
Harry Odell: Alex.

163
000:19:44.680 --> 000:19:49.289
Alex Yelland: In the head to head lioness. It's got more wins, which is ultimately all that matters.

164
000:19:50.910 --> 000:19:56.630
Harry Odell: Winds are good. There was a second hand there disappeared.

165
000:20:10.830 --> 000:20:13.650
Harry Odell: Sorry, Pete. Does anyone else want to come in? Come on!

166
000:20:13.680 --> 000:20:16.740
Harry Odell: Where in Ronaldo versi preferences.

167
000:20:16.790 --> 000:20:18.669
Harry Odell: data, whatever it may be.

168
000:20:21.750 --> 000:20:23.210
Harry Odell: Who do you want in your team?

169
000:20:23.380 --> 000:20:28.109
Peter Shatwell: Was that? Sh should should I say something?

170
000:20:28.610 --> 000:20:29.310
Harry Odell: Yeah.

171
000:20:29.540 --> 000:20:33.589
Peter Shatwell: We'll go to Victoria, and we'll come back to you after Victoria.

172
000:20:34.710 --> 000:20:45.160
Victoria Sanders: who's cheaper. because then it matters like. you know, if you were like actually buying for a team. But Ronaldo's like.

173
000:20:45.190 --> 000:20:52.730
Victoria Sanders: or messy like way more expensive. Then you might as well take Ronaldo, because a lot of the figures aren't that different? Really?

174
000:20:53.890 --> 000:21:02.490
Harry Odell: Yeah, okay, so what we're looking at here isn't telling us the full picture price value wages only to factor in

175
000:21:02.660 --> 000:21:06.940
Harry Odell: love. That Alex. Oh, sorry.

176
000:21:08.420 --> 000:21:18.980
Alex Kononov: Yeah, it's a difficult question. But basically, I don't know. Based on statistics. For example, the number of goes per game.

177
000:21:19.600 --> 000:21:23.989
Alex Kononov: Hmm Lionel Messi is

178
000:21:24.790 --> 000:21:28.439
Alex Kononov: more efficient than Ronaldo.

179
000:21:28.540 --> 000:21:32.740
Alex Kononov: and the same goes for Ballon d'or.

180
000:21:33.030 --> 000:21:41.909
Alex Kononov: Which means that's internationally, he's recognized by the experts, so I don't know, and also he wins in head to head matches

181
000:21:42.120 --> 000:21:45.240
Alex Kononov: by quite a serious amount

182
000:21:45.810 --> 000:21:46.920
Alex Kononov: of plants.

183
000:21:47.280 --> 000:21:49.090
Harry Odell: Yeah. Kelly.

184
000:21:49.550 --> 000:21:59.969
kelly: I can see the same messy because he has another range of 20 goals per year. and Leonardo 19. So in 2 years we can have more goals.

185
000:22:01.730 --> 000:22:06.490
Harry Odell: Okay? Cold? Peter, go on last comment.

186
000:22:08.130 --> 000:22:17.700
Peter Shatwell: and I don't think I can add much like. I'm not. I'm not a football person. I would have thought you should.

187
000:22:18.640 --> 000:22:32.099
Peter Shatwell: I guess. Weigh how much you you value. Your club wins over your international wins. And so, like the club goals per game and international goals per game are just just have different weights. And like, if you think

188
000:22:32.370 --> 000:22:36.119
Peter Shatwell: winning on the international stage is more important than Gooey Ronaldo.

189
000:22:37.850 --> 000:22:40.099
Karum Singh: Well, you're called the World Cup. So it doesn't matter

190
000:22:42.840 --> 000:22:44.700
Harry Odell: of that, rob

191
000:22:45.620 --> 000:22:49.780
robmadigan: just one. Our thing isn't around a little bit older than I see, too.

192
000:22:49.930 --> 000:22:54.080
So could those facts be slightly skewed by the factions probably played for a bit longer.

193
000:22:54.370 --> 000:22:55.450
robmadigan: Just a thought.

194
000:22:58.360 --> 000:23:00.739
Harry Odell: Have we got any Monday night funds?

195
000:23:04.380 --> 000:23:05.900
Can't see people

196
000:23:07.220 --> 000:23:08.709
Harry Odell: any money night funds.

197
000:23:13.150 --> 000:23:16.240
Harry Odell: no lot of head shakes. I'm surprised.

198
000:23:16.820 --> 000:23:18.800
Harry Odell: Okay, so I'm in Monday night. Fine!

199
000:23:19.030 --> 000:23:22.380
Harry Odell: What about the idea that Ronaldo is?

200
000:23:24.360 --> 000:23:30.460
Harry Odell: How do I not swear at this point? You can fill in the blanks. Ronaldo is beep

201
000:23:30.680 --> 000:23:37.000
Harry Odell: or a beep? What about that like? Do we still want him in our team.

202
000:23:38.540 --> 000:23:40.219
Harry Odell: Mars? What does that beat me?

203
000:23:40.570 --> 000:23:42.710
Karum Singh: Why is that beep?

204
000:23:42.990 --> 000:23:47.780
Harry Odell: Fill in the blank with a bad word, basically, what's the first now?

205
000:23:47.960 --> 000:23:53.380
Harry Odell: C or D, or any of the above?

206
000:23:56.130 --> 000:23:59.080
Harry Odell: But yeah, do we still want him in the team.

207
000:24:00.790 --> 000:24:01.620
Karum Singh: Yeah.

208
000:24:02.590 --> 000:24:09.610
Alex Kononov: If it has negative impacts on the sales of merchandise or tickets? Of course not.

209
000:24:10.620 --> 000:24:12.630
Karum Singh: It would have a positive effect.

210
000:24:15.070 --> 000:24:26.160
robmadigan: probably would affect the the older team members as well. And the you know, the team chemistry. So that's a that's a bad thing, cause it could drop the performance as as a team as a whole.

211
000:24:27.550 --> 000:24:29.860
Harry Odell: Yeah, I love that show you had your hand up.

212
000:24:31.630 --> 000:24:33.839
Shiri: It was the same exact point as Rob

213
000:24:35.140 --> 000:24:38.280
Harry Odell: find that first wrong. Okay, yeah. Hello.

214
000:24:38.490 --> 000:24:43.640
Harry Odell: Point here. Well, I'll actually, I'll leave that for now.

215
000:24:43.950 --> 000:24:51.860
Harry Odell: is basically this. So this is the takeaway from today's little chat

216
000:24:52.590 --> 000:25:00.309
Harry Odell: not to jump to conclusions. And this is our little bear doing exactly that. So if we just quickly recap.

217
000:25:00.750 --> 000:25:11.830
Harry Odell: In this case the date is telling us at least what we think is armor. The red points. In this case it's stop selling ice creams and

218
000:25:11.940 --> 000:25:26.749
Harry Odell: mergers in New York. I'm gonna go down and we're gonna stop shark attacks. In this case, our intuition is saying the guys telling us it's green, but actually ignore what he's saying, and trust the data in this case.

219
000:25:27.130 --> 000:25:31.600
Harry Odell: And then this, it's just a toss up right? We've got stats that

220
000:25:31.770 --> 000:25:57.289
Harry Odell: at telling those a story to quite evenly match. But then there's other factors that are coming into it. And my opinions quite strong. Don't really like Ronaldo. I probably wouldn't want him in my team again for various factors. Price, like Victoria said, might come into it. So there's more to it than just to date. So when it comes to bringing in some somebody. So when we're thinking about

221
000:25:57.490 --> 000:26:08.269
Harry Odell: data and conclusions and trying to tell that story, just have always have in mind that there's more to it than what the data is telling us. So there's always a trade off between

222
000:26:08.530 --> 000:26:23.459
Harry Odell: intuition subject matter, expertise, got feeling. You know, we are humans, and they're all valid when it comes to decision making. So all that stuff sits on one side, and then we have the data on what that's telling us on the other. And it's like a scale, right?

223
000:26:23.610 --> 000:26:44.260
Harry Odell: And we need to use judgment anytime. We make in a data driven decision about where we gonna land on that scale? Do we override what the date is telling us at face value, with what we know or do we trust, what we know and ignore what the date is seemingly telling us so. A little bit of food for fault this morning.

224
000:26:44.640 --> 000:26:49.780
Harry Odell: And that is everything. I saw see you, I think

225
000:26:50.130 --> 000:26:52.409
10 am. So go have a coffee

226
000:26:52.520 --> 000:26:57.250
Harry Odell: chill out and catch you later. Bye, bye.

227
000:26:57.490 --> 000:26:58.300
Florine: Hi!
