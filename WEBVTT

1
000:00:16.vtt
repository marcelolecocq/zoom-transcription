000:00:16.059 --> 000:00:27.799
Steph Wright: I always like to catch the initial reactions of this on the recording. Hence why, the creepy recording lady is here straight away rather than when I have some slides or something else to show you.

2
000:00:28.190 --> 000:00:30.400
Steph Wright: So Hello!

3
000:00:32.870 --> 000:00:41.019
Steph Wright: We're just gonna wait for everybody to come in and turn their cameras on, because I need to assess a few things. I'm gonna be needing to see you

4
000:00:41.040 --> 000:00:42.880
Steph Wright: in order to do that.

5
000:00:43.150 --> 000:00:45.370
Steph Wright: So Facebook

6
000:00:45.680 --> 000:00:57.799
Steph Wright: bear there, or some of the expressions be interesting to see how the expressions translate into what we're about to do. So on a scale of one to 10

7
000:00:58.250 --> 000:01:02.669
Steph Wright: where one is. Steph's my friend. Right? I'm fine with her.

8
000:01:03.150 --> 000:01:06.250
Steph Wright: 10 is Steph's gone. Die

9
000:01:07.230 --> 000:01:11.960
Steph Wright: right? Where do we sit? Currently be honest.

10
000:01:13.320 --> 000:01:26.149
Steph Wright: go on. You'll be amazed at the range of numbers I've had in the past right? All those people laughing right. If you want to throw eights, nines and tens in there, go through it. I've asked for your honesty. It's what I'm looking for.

11
000:01:27.200 --> 000:01:37.730
Steph Wright: God damn it, it's so much more fun when you all hate me. After that okay. different question. Scale of one to 10. How frustrated are you

12
000:01:38.850 --> 000:01:41.010
Steph Wright: after that fire drill?

13
000:01:41.060 --> 000:01:47.430
Steph Wright: Right? 10 is, I am epictet frustrated. I want to throw my laptop out the window. One is

14
000:01:50.430 --> 000:01:51.260
Steph Wright: okay.

15
000:01:52.070 --> 000:01:54.529
Steph Wright: And this is just a hands up.

16
000:01:54.570 --> 000:01:55.749
Steph Wright: not hands up.

17
000:01:55.990 --> 000:02:01.370
Steph Wright: Type job. Oh, don't worry about being mean with me old enough and ugly enough. I can take it

18
000:02:03.810 --> 000:02:09.129
Steph Wright: is who felt panicked when they read that they'd broken Gdpr.

19
000:02:09.590 --> 000:02:11.000
Steph Wright: Out of curiosity.

20
000:02:14.310 --> 000:02:17.100
Steph Wright: Okay. if this was in real life.

21
000:02:17.490 --> 000:02:25.890
Steph Wright: all of you should have your hands up like right up in the air. Hands up! This would be a moment.

22
000:02:26.390 --> 000:02:30.030
Steph Wright: 4 panic. This has happened.

23
000:02:30.260 --> 000:02:34.920
Steph Wright: not in the exact form that I have shown you here.

24
000:02:35.120 --> 000:02:44.289
Steph Wright: But let's just say that when pulling together some personal information regarding employees I might have published

25
000:02:44.630 --> 000:02:46.460
Steph Wright: somewhere. I shouldn't.

26
000:02:48.630 --> 000:02:52.650
Steph Wright: and bosses were not happy.

27
000:02:55.090 --> 000:02:58.109
Steph Wright: Alex, you may mock me at your will.

28
000:02:58.160 --> 000:03:02.719
Alex Kononov: No mockery in my plans.

29
000:03:02.880 --> 000:03:13.330
Alex Kononov: I wanted to ask actually, are you sure that it is not within the legitimate interest clause, because those are the business partners

30
000:03:13.380 --> 000:03:21.100
Alex Kononov: and sending them gifts is a part of normal interactions between business partners

31
000:03:21.160 --> 000:03:24.780
Alex Kononov: within European business culture.

32
000:03:25.420 --> 000:03:34.429
Steph Wright: And if we were talking B to B. So business to business, then potentially, you would be right. This could come under legitimate interest.

33
000:03:34.530 --> 000:03:39.779
Steph Wright: By the way, all this stuff we're talking about, I'm going to get you to go and research afterwards everyone.

34
000:03:40.000 --> 000:03:43.859
Steph Wright: So don't panic. You don't have to pull it a hundred percent.

35
000:03:44.770 --> 000:03:47.850
Steph Wright: These were personal addresses

36
000:03:48.770 --> 000:03:52.210
Steph Wright: in order for legitimate interest to apply

37
000:03:52.430 --> 000:03:53.520
Steph Wright: the

38
000:03:54.210 --> 000:03:58.480
Steph Wright: the game to the company has to be deemed to outweigh the harm

39
000:03:58.540 --> 000:04:00.110
Steph Wright: to the individual.

40
000:04:00.630 --> 000:04:07.970
Steph Wright: Put on a public, because that's what the power bi dashboard is. It's public. Anybody can see that

41
000:04:08.260 --> 000:04:09.930
Steph Wright: to put their part.

42
000:04:11.710 --> 000:04:15.270
Steph Wright: Personal address is boxing.

43
000:04:15.660 --> 000:04:22.810
Steph Wright: so you would have to weigh up is the harm of potentially someone's stalker finding out where they now live.

44
000:04:22.880 --> 000:04:25.470
Steph Wright: because they've been following everything

45
000:04:25.670 --> 000:04:29.290
Steph Wright: that has anything to do with their say. Ex partners.

46
000:04:29.940 --> 000:04:32.909
Steph Wright: Life right? Is that harm

47
000:04:33.070 --> 000:04:34.360
Steph Wright: outweighed

48
000:04:34.590 --> 000:04:39.080
Steph Wright: by sending a business gift that may or may not increase sales.

49
000:04:39.300 --> 000:04:41.249
Steph Wright: I would argue that it isn't.

50
000:04:41.500 --> 000:04:46.500
Steph Wright: and if you do not know whether it is a business address

51
000:04:46.980 --> 000:04:48.760
Steph Wright: or a personal address.

52
000:04:48.980 --> 000:04:53.530
Steph Wright: the weight of that app is on you to find out.

53
000:04:55.460 --> 000:04:58.449
Steph Wright: All that would have taken was a quick check, and I could have confirmed.

54
000:05:00.360 --> 000:05:02.999
Steph Wright: It's asking. The question

55
000:05:03.020 --> 000:05:06.099
Steph Wright: is, what's going to allow you to avoid

56
000:05:06.470 --> 000:05:08.940
Steph Wright: getting into hot water

57
000:05:09.200 --> 000:05:10.009
Steph Wright: in a month.

58
000:05:10.750 --> 000:05:35.560
Elymma Mensah: I wanted to ask, so would this be a situation where you would like protect the the document with a password? Or would it still be GP. Dl. Violation to pass them like the details between other workers like is the PA, and like the marketing person having that information still a breach? Or is it just if people outside of the business

59
000:05:35.610 --> 000:05:40.739
Elymma Mensah: have? Oh, thank you. But yeah, what's the

60
000:05:40.880 --> 000:05:42.200
Elymma Mensah: how? How does?

61
000:05:43.090 --> 000:05:47.650
Steph Wright: So I I'm gonna answer the question for everyone to consider.

62
000:05:47.890 --> 000:05:49.730
Steph Wright: Imagine you work in a very big

63
000:05:49.980 --> 000:05:52.419
Steph Wright: company, and you've had a running

64
000:05:52.480 --> 000:05:53.610
Steph Wright: with someone there.

65
000:05:53.980 --> 000:05:57.550
Steph Wright: and they happened to be one of the people on the password protected

66
000:05:57.670 --> 000:06:03.950
Steph Wright: list to see that dashboard, because no one knows that there is bad blood between you and that person.

67
000:06:03.970 --> 000:06:06.359
Steph Wright: and they then find out your home address

68
000:06:08.380 --> 000:06:13.649
Steph Wright: by Nod. Yes, I'd be fine with that, and shake. No, I wouldn't show me how you feel.

69
000:06:15.840 --> 000:06:25.589
Steph Wright: and that that's what Gdpr is actually about, right data protection laws, aren't there to make life difficult for data analysts?

70
000:06:25.610 --> 000:06:28.890
Steph Wright: I know it's going to feel like it at times.

71
000:06:29.150 --> 000:06:32.200
Steph Wright: but we are essentially superheroes

72
000:06:32.390 --> 000:06:39.360
Steph Wright: protecting the personal information that we hold about our customers, about our clients.

73
000:06:40.090 --> 000:06:46.430
Steph Wright: and it's up to us to make sure that we have. And this this would have been the difference between a breach

74
000:06:46.660 --> 000:06:50.640
Steph Wright: and not a breach did we have their permission.

75
000:06:51.870 --> 000:07:00.860
Steph Wright: If, when you collect data on people, you tell them that it will be displayed publicly like you have it as a disclaimer on a form.

76
000:07:01.270 --> 000:07:04.329
Steph Wright: Then Gdpr, actually, in large part doesn't apply

77
000:07:04.770 --> 000:07:10.620
Steph Wright: because you've set as long as you use it for the what you've said you're gonna use it for.

78
000:07:11.110 --> 000:07:12.910
Steph Wright: It falls under

79
000:07:13.580 --> 000:07:23.170
Steph Wright: one of the pillars, saying, This is okay. but if you use it even for the most positively intended thing.

80
000:07:23.290 --> 000:07:30.870
Steph Wright: I don't know what phrase I was going for there. But I really hope that you guys have got some idea where I was headed like, in a good way, we're trying to be nice people.

81
000:07:31.020 --> 000:07:34.189
Steph Wright: It doesn't actually change the fact

82
000:07:34.530 --> 000:07:39.629
Steph Wright: that we could. And yes, this is an extreme. I know it is.

83
000:07:39.770 --> 000:07:47.870
Steph Wright: but they, for full disclosure, had a stalker. and my friend works for a domestic violence. Charity

84
000:07:47.970 --> 000:07:55.260
Steph Wright: so knows about having to keep people safe and their details, and like the huge effect it could have.

85
000:07:55.690 --> 000:08:04.010
Steph Wright: It's we are trying to protect those situations. Yes, Gdpr covers a whole load of things to stop us being exploited.

86
000:08:04.780 --> 000:08:09.179
Steph Wright: But it's kind of like if we have some annoying rules that we have to work within

87
000:08:09.230 --> 000:08:17.139
Steph Wright: in order to make sure that we don't put someone in harm's way. I think that pretty much describes society.

88
000:08:17.150 --> 000:08:18.290
Elymma Mensah: B.

89
000:08:18.670 --> 000:08:31.140
Elymma Mensah: Also how much of the information cause I know about you. Dpr, but like, I don't know about like, if if we're working in a certain like like. Say, this happened in real life? Would we know how much of the is there like a set

90
000:08:31.360 --> 000:08:46.480
Steph Wright: amount of data that's allowed to be shed or set that crosses the line like, is it just the address crossing the line? Or it's the line? Oh, so it's known as personally identifiable information. So why, so their name.

91
000:08:47.280 --> 000:08:51.409
Steph Wright: So you'd be amazed. What comes on it? Name, address, date of birth.

92
000:08:51.790 --> 000:08:55.830
Steph Wright: All the things that can be used to clone your identity

93
000:08:55.870 --> 000:09:03.979
Steph Wright: are pretty much covered. My dad had his identity stolen. He gets stopped every time he goes through passport control.

94
000:09:04.430 --> 000:09:08.219
Steph Wright: Well, I burn things with your addresses on.

95
000:09:08.720 --> 000:09:16.379
Steph Wright: Everyone is the big advice that I learned from this happening to my dad like way back in the early Nauties.

96
000:09:16.960 --> 000:09:19.500
Steph Wright: right? So you've been dealing with this for 20 odd years.

97
000:09:20.290 --> 000:09:22.859
Steph Wright: There is another Malcolm France, out there somewhere.

98
000:09:23.050 --> 000:09:26.040
Steph Wright: It was apparently him not who I would choose to be.

99
000:09:26.170 --> 000:09:35.130
Steph Wright: but it's if you go and search for Pi. It will give you a list of those controlled bits. Gdpr doesn't just cover

100
000:09:35.330 --> 000:09:38.360
Steph Wright: the the sharing of information publicly.

101
000:09:38.680 --> 000:09:43.060
Steph Wright: It also covers what we use the data for in the back end.

102
000:09:44.170 --> 000:09:53.099
Steph Wright: and we will come onto the the really easy way that we will avoid getting in trouble with this sort of thing

103
000:09:53.350 --> 000:09:59.940
Steph Wright: in the future as well as if anybody knows the the sanctions.

104
000:09:59.970 --> 000:10:01.569
Steph Wright: Shall Lewis say.

105
000:10:01.830 --> 000:10:05.500
Steph Wright: for reaching Gdpr. Get ready to share with us?

106
000:10:05.510 --> 000:10:09.510
Steph Wright: Shiri? I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. It was a very long point I was making.

107
000:10:11.780 --> 000:10:15.150
Shiri: That's okay. I was wondering.

108
000:10:15.540 --> 000:10:19.390
Shiri: I can't think of how logistically to do it right now. But

109
000:10:19.860 --> 000:10:24.060
Shiri: where, in one of the tables there was a reseller. Id

110
000:10:24.150 --> 000:10:28.159
Shiri: had we use that as opposed to having their name and their address.

111
000:10:28.620 --> 000:10:34.670
Shiri: and just write it and been like sorry can't give you the address, but feel free to. Oh, no, wait, cause

112
000:10:35.350 --> 000:10:37.380
Shiri: I've just answered my own question.

113
000:10:38.440 --> 000:10:42.290
Shiri: I'm really glad. That's where that's where it gets

114
000:10:42.350 --> 000:10:44.950
Steph Wright: harder to ascertain

115
000:10:44.960 --> 000:10:51.350
Steph Wright: this. A problem because you're going the 2 peak like 2 pieces of information separately.

116
000:10:52.350 --> 000:11:01.550
Steph Wright: That is not really helping. You find the person put them together, and suddenly you are zeroing in on the person you want. Add another thing

117
000:11:01.670 --> 000:11:08.099
Steph Wright: to it, like a date of birth. you found someone. And so it's we

118
000:11:08.560 --> 000:11:15.279
Steph Wright: attempt like our level best. We do not share anything like that in public spaces.

119
000:11:16.140 --> 000:11:22.270
Steph Wright: to people groups for things that people haven't specifically said.

120
000:11:22.560 --> 000:11:23.730
Steph Wright: that's okay.

121
000:11:25.670 --> 000:11:32.250
Steph Wright: As soon as you see names, addresses day of births, I need the Gdpr. Claxon

122
000:11:32.470 --> 000:11:34.610
Steph Wright: to start going off in your brain

123
000:11:34.800 --> 000:11:43.409
Steph Wright: and for you to question. Oh, so in the chat we have one thing. So a potential fine for a Gdpr breach 20 million.

124
000:11:44.220 --> 000:11:45.150
Steph Wright: Alex

125
000:11:45.310 --> 000:11:53.860
Steph Wright: 20 million up to 20 million or up to 4 yearly. And over whichever is higher.

126
000:11:54.510 --> 000:11:55.839
Alex Kononov: So yeah.

127
000:11:57.210 --> 000:12:06.229
Steph Wright: that's the scary part is when you start getting into the percentages of turnover. Now, your company

128
000:12:06.310 --> 000:12:08.690
Steph Wright: will be deemed responsible

129
000:12:09.130 --> 000:12:12.390
Steph Wright: for the breach, because they didn't have a way

130
000:12:12.410 --> 000:12:13.560
Steph Wright: to stop it.

131
000:12:14.120 --> 000:12:20.570
Steph Wright: but by thumbs up, thumbs down. Are you personally liable for any sanction?

132
000:12:28.040 --> 000:12:35.879
Steph Wright: 2 thumbs up, and I'm going to hand over to my colleague Finn. He's one of our new coaches. By the way, please wave Hello! Make him feel welcome.

133
000:12:36.060 --> 000:12:39.039
Steph Wright: He's going to tell you a little story.

134
000:12:40.590 --> 000:12:58.050
Finn: hey? Guys, nice to meet you all. That's my first day yesterday. So I'm very excited to be joining you all. I'll be helping a lot with the apply part of the course as well. but I've got one example of Gdpr, so I've been teaching for the last couple of years, and one of my students a year ago is working for

135
000:12:58.150 --> 000:13:09.720
Finn: a really really large multi corporate company like billions and billions of dollars in revenue, and they publish the dashboard with personal, identifiable information.

136
000:13:09.780 --> 000:13:16.960
Finn: And it all, and they're only like 20 years old, brand new. They're about to get their qualification, and they very nearly lost their job because of it.

137
000:13:17.150 --> 000:13:46.379
Finn: Even though their manager and that team should have probably known about it, and should have been checking up on that work those his responsibility when he published his dashboard with personal identifying information, and he very, very nearly lost his job. You're suspended for 2 weeks without pay. This is the kind these are. Why, it's really important. You're gonna ask those questions to your managers, to your leaders to make sure that you're not accidentally doing something, cause your managers and leaders will sometimes ask question things for you to do which

138
000:13:46.510 --> 000:13:56.320
Finn: I'm not possible without breaking. Gdpr, and that's when you got to go back and say, Hey, is this actually okay? Do I need to think about this in any.

139
000:13:56.800 --> 000:14:06.499
Finn: every detail, and you'll also be doing Gdpr, Gdpr courses when you join your new wells as well. So at that point the responsibility very much lies on.

140
000:14:09.700 --> 000:14:12.450
Steph Wright: Make sure you actually pay attention

141
000:14:12.880 --> 000:14:24.490
Steph Wright: to those courses that they send you. I know. I know they're boring. It's why I don't set units on. Gdpr. It's why there's no big reading or a taught session. It's not the most joyful thing

142
000:14:24.860 --> 000:14:27.590
Steph Wright: in our careers, but it does

143
000:14:27.750 --> 000:14:32.219
Steph Wright: give you the the rules and restrictions for keeping yourself safe

144
000:14:32.680 --> 000:14:34.880
Steph Wright: working with people.

145
000:14:35.490 --> 000:14:42.219
Steph Wright: And that's the thing that Finn has put in the chat. That is what keeps you safe.

146
000:14:43.470 --> 000:14:45.510
Steph Wright: It is cool, but it has a little acronym.

147
000:14:45.710 --> 000:14:52.780
Steph Wright: Steph's favourite acronym. It's Cy A. I don't know if I've told it you before, but if I haven't any guesses

148
000:14:54.560 --> 000:15:00.110
Elymma Mensah: oh, come on, keep that, you say, keep! Oh, cover your ass, cover your ass.

149
000:15:00.420 --> 000:15:02.969
Elymma Mensah: always cover your ass, because

150
000:15:03.540 --> 000:15:11.100
Steph Wright: the people above you will be covering their ass. The people above them will be covering their us. They will not be covering yours

151
000:15:11.340 --> 000:15:12.640
Steph Wright: for the most part

152
000:15:13.290 --> 000:15:19.850
Steph Wright: as as much as I would like to tell you. Every manager you get, every leader you get will genuinely care about you

153
000:15:20.030 --> 000:15:21.479
Steph Wright: as a human being

154
000:15:22.010 --> 000:15:24.000
Steph Wright: right statistically.

155
000:15:24.550 --> 000:15:28.260
Steph Wright: that can't always be the case. We're always going to have at least an outlier.

156
000:15:28.920 --> 000:15:36.639
Steph Wright: So it's making sure that you cover yourself. And so, if you had asked, do I have permission

157
000:15:37.030 --> 000:15:43.350
Steph Wright: to publish this information? The weight of responsibility lies from the person that says yes.

158
000:15:44.090 --> 000:15:49.580
Steph Wright: because the big people who I can't remember what they're called, but who enforce

159
000:15:49.620 --> 000:15:54.180
Steph Wright: Gdpr and whack you with the big finds will go through the audit trail.

160
000:15:54.560 --> 000:16:01.869
Steph Wright: We'll be like this person was new. They asked for clarification. You as their manager, the data owner, whoever it is.

161
000:16:02.390 --> 000:16:03.190
Steph Wright: said

162
000:16:03.700 --> 000:16:06.849
Steph Wright: that this data was fine to be used.

163
000:16:08.990 --> 000:16:12.590
Steph Wright: that mercenary, but do everything through email.

164
000:16:13.090 --> 000:16:17.119
Steph Wright: everything to do with a request, even if the request comes via slack.

165
000:16:17.130 --> 000:16:21.499
Steph Wright: confirm the requirements. What needs to be done

166
000:16:21.520 --> 000:16:23.909
Steph Wright: and clarify if

167
000:16:23.980 --> 000:16:25.610
Steph Wright: pi is involved?

168
000:16:27.030 --> 000:16:30.779
Steph Wright: Has permission been given for A to be used

169
000:16:30.840 --> 000:16:33.589
Steph Wright: for what they've asked you to do?

170
000:16:34.220 --> 000:16:40.169
Steph Wright: And B. If they've asked for it to be published. Do you have express permission for that

171
000:16:40.220 --> 000:16:46.350
Steph Wright: to do so? And then, Alex, if that's when legitimate interest would come in

172
000:16:46.820 --> 000:16:50.239
Steph Wright: right. That's when the person above, you will tell you that.

173
000:16:50.900 --> 000:16:55.559
Steph Wright: and then again, that weight is on them. To have made it clear that the company

174
000:16:55.830 --> 000:16:59.900
Steph Wright: has assessed the risk, reward

175
000:17:00.100 --> 000:17:05.150
Steph Wright: benefit as well as deemed it to be a legitimate thing to do.

176
000:17:06.410 --> 000:17:11.690
Steph Wright: So it's going in as an entry level analyst. You don't get paid enough

177
000:17:12.060 --> 000:17:15.190
Steph Wright: to take the risk. You don't.

178
000:17:15.670 --> 000:17:24.430
Steph Wright: That's why you get paid more and more money as you go up in a business, even though it looks like you have less actual work to do.

179
000:17:25.030 --> 000:17:29.020
Steph Wright: It's because the decisions you make are so big

180
000:17:29.500 --> 000:17:36.340
Steph Wright: that the ramifications are huge. So if you say it's fine, and it's not

181
000:17:36.500 --> 000:17:38.319
Steph Wright: potentially off to jail.

182
000:17:40.350 --> 000:17:44.370
Steph Wright: So I'm not saying, Give C. 3 execs and all that an easy ride.

183
000:17:44.660 --> 000:17:49.170
Steph Wright: Right? Yes, it's a hard job, and there are things they have to do. But also they get to have a lot of fun.

184
000:17:49.960 --> 000:17:56.349
Steph Wright: But it's just make sure that you're not putting yourself in a position where you

185
000:17:56.400 --> 000:17:59.139
Steph Wright: are going to get in trouble, but also

186
000:17:59.150 --> 000:18:00.540
Steph Wright: feel the guilt

187
000:18:00.740 --> 000:18:03.750
Steph Wright: of potentially causing harm

188
000:18:04.540 --> 000:18:05.830
Steph Wright: from doing this.

189
000:18:06.140 --> 000:18:13.909
Steph Wright: I'm going to tug on the heart strings as well as the mercenary approach. I need this message to land. Ask the questions.

190
000:18:14.200 --> 000:18:15.500
Steph Wright: cover your off.

191
000:18:16.300 --> 000:18:23.570
Steph Wright: and by doing that you will protect the people whose data you're working with. Naturally.

192
000:18:24.820 --> 000:18:34.729
Steph Wright: right? You don't even have to envisage yourself as a superhero. If you're not a big fan of Kate's and Spandex. though I think everybody knows they've got one hidden inside them somewhere, right?

193
000:18:36.160 --> 000:18:42.209
Steph Wright: Have a rainy Sunday draw your superhero. It's quite a fun exercise, even if you're any good at stick people

194
000:18:43.000 --> 000:18:45.610
Steph Wright: right? Those are the things that step.

195
000:18:45.640 --> 000:18:51.959
Steph Wright: Why am I talking in the third person? I must really be out of it today. I'm sorry. This is what lack of sleep does to me.

196
000:18:53.890 --> 000:18:58.659
Steph Wright: Those are the things that I really needed to convey

197
000:18:59.100 --> 000:19:09.800
Steph Wright: and to check the fact that I don't have to worry about my safety amongst you all is quite a nice thing. but hit us with questions like anything you want to know. Anything

198
000:19:09.860 --> 000:19:11.499
Steph Wright: like. I can sort of

199
000:19:11.550 --> 000:19:14.450
Steph Wright: take you through some of the technical things. If

200
000:19:14.460 --> 000:19:21.449
Steph Wright: there are no further questions on the data protectionee site of staffs.

201
000:19:23.740 --> 000:19:28.500
Steph Wright: because I've sent you my queries. You've got my dashboard die Belt.

202
000:19:29.320 --> 000:19:33.360
Steph Wright: You can take your time now to rebuild these blend.

203
000:19:34.110 --> 000:19:46.519
blens: Okay, it relates to what we're talking about, like, what about sharing information verbally. not like publishing it, whatever, but like may, outside of work, like with maybe colleagues or even friends.

204
000:19:46.650 --> 000:19:49.209
blens: So how does that balance?

205
000:19:50.600 --> 000:19:55.530
Steph Wright: I would say the chances of that being policed are very slim.

206
000:19:56.810 --> 000:20:01.940
Steph Wright: If we're be, if we're talking specifically about Gdpr and the the chance for sanctions.

207
000:20:02.680 --> 000:20:05.430
Steph Wright: But I always

208
000:20:05.580 --> 000:20:07.860
Steph Wright: do they? How would I feel

209
000:20:07.920 --> 000:20:14.570
Steph Wright: if I found out someone else had been sharing this piece of information about me?

210
000:20:16.410 --> 000:20:18.700
Steph Wright: If I wouldn't be very happy about it.

211
000:20:18.830 --> 000:20:23.190
Steph Wright: I wouldn't share it. It's a fairly good litmus test, but

212
000:20:24.190 --> 000:20:28.180
Steph Wright: that is only when we're talking about everybody involved

213
000:20:28.280 --> 000:20:29.920
Steph Wright: being peers.

214
000:20:30.610 --> 000:20:37.090
Steph Wright: The minute hierarchy stums starts to come into this, especially if you, as the speaker.

215
000:20:37.310 --> 000:20:40.240
Steph Wright: are in a managerial or a leader position.

216
000:20:40.990 --> 000:20:42.020
Steph Wright: then

217
000:20:42.450 --> 000:20:47.389
Steph Wright: then it gets trickier. because your word carries more weight.

218
000:20:48.760 --> 000:20:57.200
Steph Wright: and therefore anything that is allied to that information that you give out it can either positively or negatively affect

219
000:20:57.380 --> 000:20:59.550
Steph Wright: certain things. And so it's best

220
000:21:00.250 --> 000:21:09.489
Steph Wright: that we don't share people's birthdays. This is a really common one that you get asked is, Oh, when is such and such as birthday? We want to send them a cart.

221
000:21:09.620 --> 000:21:14.189
Steph Wright: or we want to organise a thing. Easiest thing. Go to the person

222
000:21:14.440 --> 000:21:20.220
Steph Wright: dude. We'd like to see something for your birthday. Are you happy with me to share that information.

223
000:21:20.790 --> 000:21:27.150
Steph Wright: and I'll be honest with you. My answer question would be, no. I really don't like

224
000:21:27.270 --> 000:21:35.789
Steph Wright: that sort of thing. It makes me feel very on the spot. Yes, I'm aware I'm quite a flamboyant person, but I've got some quirks. What can I say?

225
000:21:36.720 --> 000:21:40.889
Steph Wright: And I've worked with other people as well, who have gone off sick.

226
000:21:40.990 --> 000:21:46.819
Steph Wright: and the company has wanted to send stuff. and we've had access to the address.

227
000:21:47.430 --> 000:21:49.549
Steph Wright: and I've had to get them to stop

228
000:21:49.600 --> 000:21:54.819
Steph Wright: whilst I, Whatsapp, the person and go, are you okay with us doing this

229
000:21:57.140 --> 000:22:00.259
Steph Wright: again? A. I want to make sure that they genuinely are.

230
000:22:00.680 --> 000:22:04.779
Steph Wright: But, B, if I don't have that permission and that address gets used.

231
000:22:05.540 --> 000:22:07.510
Steph Wright: that would be a technical breach.

232
000:22:07.800 --> 000:22:08.940
Steph Wright: And so

233
000:22:09.160 --> 000:22:13.090
Steph Wright: thinking about those things when you're making some of those

234
000:22:13.410 --> 000:22:15.630
Steph Wright: kind of office culture

235
000:22:15.770 --> 000:22:17.060
Steph Wright: requests.

236
000:22:17.290 --> 000:22:19.450
Steph Wright: Don't be surprised if people say no.

237
000:22:19.950 --> 000:22:22.020
Steph Wright: it's not them being difficult.

238
000:22:22.340 --> 000:22:25.569
Steph Wright: It's that Gdpr. Will.

239
000:22:26.570 --> 000:22:27.489
Steph Wright: if they do

240
000:22:28.660 --> 000:22:32.910
Steph Wright: cheer. You look very concerned by what I was just saying.

241
000:22:32.920 --> 000:22:36.570
Shiri: No, I'm trying to think through my own question.

242
000:22:36.670 --> 000:22:53.540
Shiri:  basically, I'm sorry if this is gonna come out as before. I can't. I haven't figured it out as of such. So as May gave us the tables right. They have access to tables as well

243
000:22:54.840 --> 000:22:57.490
Shiri: by that logic.

244
000:22:57.680 --> 000:23:04.560
Shiri: Is it just because we've built a dashboard which is public that we've now breached? Gdpr.

245
000:23:05.600 --> 000:23:07.989
Steph Wright: that's what makes it very obvious

246
000:23:08.090 --> 000:23:14.299
Steph Wright: we've breached. Gdpr, if asthma centers that table and we use the data

247
000:23:14.380 --> 000:23:16.359
Steph Wright: even didn't publish it.

248
000:23:16.390 --> 000:23:22.459
Steph Wright: But we didn't have permission for using it for marketing purposes, which is what this is. Really.

249
000:23:22.790 --> 000:23:24.409
Steph Wright: Then, yeah, we're still in trouble.

250
000:23:25.500 --> 000:23:32.029
Steph Wright: So always check before you even start digging into things like the minute you see address

251
000:23:32.210 --> 000:23:36.019
Steph Wright: or name things like that in your column headers.

252
000:23:36.370 --> 000:23:38.159
Steph Wright: ping the email or

253
000:23:38.180 --> 000:23:43.770
Steph Wright: double check, get the verbal confirmation and then get them to confirm in writing. If it needs to be done quickly.

254
000:23:46.310 --> 000:23:50.479
Steph Wright: I think I understood your question. Is that the an answer that helped?

255
000:23:51.190 --> 000:23:54.480
Steph Wright: Okay? Then your question was great. Give them up.

256
000:23:54.700 --> 000:24:00.339
Elymma Mensah: I don't know if you're gonna go through this when you go through your kind of solution. But I wanted to know.

257
000:24:00.570 --> 000:24:08.290
Elymma Mensah: I'll question, do people do stuff like this in like industry with some one ask you to find the top, whatever of whatever

258
000:24:08.430 --> 000:24:10.730
Elymma Mensah: knowing like, cause it it?

259
000:24:10.740 --> 000:24:12.110
Elymma Mensah: Oh, they would.

260
000:24:12.140 --> 000:24:23.480
Elymma Mensah: Yes, top 5 top 10 top 100. We love a top or a box came out in. Not the way I intend

261
000:24:23.680 --> 000:24:25.499
I was like, so would they

262
000:24:25.700 --> 000:24:40.240
Elymma Mensah: when they're asking that with the knowledge of G, sorry I get the the letters mixed up. I'm gonna say, Gdpr, whatever is that's our is alright. Okay, with with their knowledge of that.

263
000:24:40.400 --> 000:24:59.749
Elymma Mensah: would they still ask, make a request like this? Or did you like specifically make it so? It was like a catch us out kind of thing? Or do people actually just request these kind of things? Would you say they would, or are they? Do they have a better? Oh, I did it on purpose.

264
000:24:59.830 --> 000:25:04.319
Steph Wright: I wanted you to feel that small sense of panic of the

265
000:25:04.380 --> 000:25:10.230
Steph Wright: No here. because yet that will stay with you.

266
000:25:10.350 --> 000:25:18.570
Steph Wright: You learn when you're feeling an emotion, positive ones work just as well as negative ones. It's why I go for joy and fun in our sessions.

267
000:25:18.950 --> 000:25:23.639
Steph Wright: But that peeding and feeling in the pit of your stomach, or maybe in your chest.

268
000:25:23.760 --> 000:25:27.439
Steph Wright: That is what's going to make you remember to check this

269
000:25:27.800 --> 000:25:35.420
Steph Wright: when this sort of data comes up enroll. So that's why. Yes, I did it on purpose, because I am an evil hariden of a woman.

270
000:25:36.490 --> 000:25:38.700
Steph Wright: The other side of it is

271
000:25:39.060 --> 000:25:49.599
Steph Wright: we we love seeing the best of performance and the worst of performance, because it gives us an idea of the range that we're dealing with in a data set.

272
000:25:50.500 --> 000:26:00.439
Steph Wright: and it's just a quick way to get a snapshot of what's going on. It's it's a really quick one to do. You often do not have to use

273
000:26:00.610 --> 000:26:02.050
Steph Wright: a window function.

274
000:26:02.270 --> 000:26:09.110
Steph Wright: You only need to use a window function when you're splitting it out by another criteria.

275
000:26:09.670 --> 000:26:12.729
Steph Wright: Otherwise you could just use an order by

276
000:26:12.910 --> 000:26:14.950
Elymma Mensah: and the limit. Yeah.

277
000:26:15.510 --> 000:26:23.050
Steph Wright: Whereas because we wanted to go by region, I was very sneaky, like I was forcing the window function in this

278
000:26:23.210 --> 000:26:25.230
Steph Wright: unless you found the table?

279
000:26:25.700 --> 000:26:28.079
Steph Wright: Oh, yes, I hope everybody

280
000:26:28.420 --> 000:26:32.409
Steph Wright: benefited from Peter's insight where he's like. Yes.

281
000:26:32.470 --> 000:26:34.380
Steph Wright: this is a handy thing to have

282
000:26:34.870 --> 000:26:36.449
Steph Wright: always ask the questions.

283
000:26:37.710 --> 000:26:38.550
Steph Wright: It's

284
000:26:40.240 --> 000:26:42.300
Steph Wright: in terms of people's performance.

285
000:26:42.680 --> 000:26:44.490
Steph Wright: Hr, do this a lot

286
000:26:45.370 --> 000:26:49.789
Steph Wright: like they're drawing up a short list of people for promotions or bonuses.

287
000:26:50.080 --> 000:26:54.370
Steph Wright: If it's salespeople, a really easy metric is, how much money did you bring in?

288
000:26:55.480 --> 000:27:02.009
Steph Wright: Who are the top 5 we've got here? Right, let's pick the top 3 from that, with some additional criteria in.

289
000:27:02.650 --> 000:27:06.199
Steph Wright: and so window functions with a rank or a row number.

290
000:27:06.210 --> 000:27:07.630
Steph Wright: They are your best friend.

291
000:27:08.440 --> 000:27:10.850
Steph Wright: as is an order by and a limit.

292
000:27:10.940 --> 000:27:13.710
Steph Wright: and you'll notice order by a limit.

293
000:27:14.930 --> 000:27:17.159
Steph Wright: Go look at it, go, look it up.

294
000:27:17.290 --> 000:27:21.710
Steph Wright: It is super useful in industry as well as some other points.

295
000:27:25.390 --> 000:27:31.350
Steph Wright: Can't say anymore. But when I stress something, there is always a point Peter.

296
000:27:32.920 --> 000:27:34.960
Peter Shatwell: yeah

297
000:27:35.580 --> 000:27:38.160
Peter Shatwell: so was

298
000:27:38.310 --> 000:27:43.130
Peter Shatwell: this in breach of Gdpr, because they're personal addresses

299
000:27:44.220 --> 000:27:51.239
Peter Shatwell: or is that when actually okay. Cause, I thought, would would this have been okay if they were overall business addresses?

300
000:27:52.470 --> 000:27:54.879
Steph Wright: That's where it would probably

301
000:27:55.190 --> 000:27:58.350
Steph Wright: all under the legitimate interest.

302
000:27:58.530 --> 000:28:03.870
Peter Shatwell: Okay? Because is that what Alex was getting

303
000:28:03.960 --> 000:28:07.149
Peter Shatwell: all right? If you think there's even a chance

304
000:28:07.490 --> 000:28:10.729
Steph Wright: it could come under that pi. Banner.

305
000:28:10.910 --> 000:28:13.350
Steph Wright: I keep wanting to say, PPI,

306
000:28:14.480 --> 000:28:21.189
Steph Wright: very different thing. Always ask the question. No one is going to think you're being difficult.

307
000:28:21.520 --> 000:28:25.909
Steph Wright: They're going to think that you understand. Gdpr.

308
000:28:26.400 --> 000:28:27.090
Peter Shatwell: -

309
000:28:27.470 --> 000:28:29.569
Steph Wright: That's not a bad thing to convey

310
000:28:29.960 --> 000:28:35.029
Steph Wright: to someone who owns your data set or who manages you and considers progression

311
000:28:36.240 --> 000:28:39.429
Steph Wright: so little bit of a sharp moment, certainly the first time.

312
000:28:40.980 --> 000:28:41.680
Peter Shatwell: Okay.

313
000:28:42.830 --> 000:28:43.540
Steph Wright: check.

314
000:28:46.110 --> 000:28:52.429
Jack C: Isn't about Gdpr, it's just about the exercise, so that the second table

315
000:28:52.680 --> 000:29:02.930
Jack C: that you mentioned that could be used. I use that is, that, had that taken away with the heavy lifting of needing to do anything in big query, like all the information was already there.

316
000:29:03.480 --> 000:29:07.720
Jack C: Okay, cool. That's what I did. And then I would do is filter it.

317
000:29:08.150 --> 000:29:09.440
Yeah. And that's

318
000:29:09.780 --> 000:29:15.750
Jack C: that's what I did. And but then I spent the next like 40 min looking at it like.

319
000:29:16.350 --> 000:29:18.689
but surely I have to do something more than this.

320
000:29:18.840 --> 000:29:22.010
Jack C: But yeah, I just wanted to clarify that

321
000:29:22.870 --> 000:29:33.320
Jack C: one of the queries that I put in shows you exactly how to take it from the first table to the ranked table. But those who

322
000:29:34.200 --> 000:29:38.720
Jack C: to have a play around. With that I do recommend going and having a look at the code.

323
000:29:39.160 --> 000:29:44.870
Steph Wright: remember being able to understand code written by someone else. Very useful skill

324
000:29:49.770 --> 000:29:50.430
here.

325
000:29:50.810 --> 000:29:54.620
Steph Wright: This is the other bit of the exercise that's important

326
000:29:54.720 --> 000:30:02.920
Steph Wright: is that by by Peter asking the question, by Jack looking and going, you know what they haven't told me this has been done.

327
000:30:03.110 --> 000:30:08.110
Steph Wright: but I think that's what's going on. It saved 40 min of time

328
000:30:08.600 --> 000:30:12.580
Steph Wright: in something you were given an hour, for. You could have had a nap

329
000:30:13.520 --> 000:30:18.510
Steph Wright: like real world done the thing I needed to go go for a walk.

330
000:30:19.030 --> 000:30:24.549
Steph Wright: This is why we find efficiencies. because it allows us to spend more time

331
000:30:24.970 --> 000:30:30.979
Steph Wright: working on the things that are interesting taking breaks. Should we be a very broken person?

332
000:30:31.230 --> 000:30:33.049
And we kind of need to do that

333
000:30:33.920 --> 000:30:38.729
Steph Wright: it's take the heavy lifting out of your day automate what you can

334
000:30:39.060 --> 000:30:45.899
Steph Wright: use, things that already exist. and pick the simplest

335
000:30:46.200 --> 000:30:54.270
Steph Wright: of all the things you could do. because your stakeholders, like way up the chain.

336
000:30:54.520 --> 000:30:57.650
Steph Wright: will never know whether you used

337
000:30:57.750 --> 000:31:02.940
Steph Wright: a really quick way or a really long, convoluted, sophisticated way.

338
000:31:03.230 --> 000:31:07.009
Steph Wright: nor would. They probably understand the difference.

339
000:31:08.720 --> 000:31:15.689
Steph Wright: And everybody who doesn't do data very much likes data to be a black box that you do your magic in.

340
000:31:15.920 --> 000:31:19.709
Steph Wright: and then you explain it to them in plain English.

341
000:31:20.380 --> 000:31:25.229
Steph Wright: right? That's our job. We are number magicians. And then Thesauruses.

342
000:31:26.730 --> 000:31:33.539
Steph Wright: But just explain things using different words. If you can get that out of your day to day you got it licked.

343
000:31:34.910 --> 000:31:40.769
Jack C: Jack. Is this a follow up to your question? If so, I will come to you now. If not, I'll go to Alex, cause I tried to be fair.

344
000:31:41.270 --> 000:31:44.200
It is kind of a follow up.

345
000:31:44.390 --> 000:32:01.819
Jack C: It was just. I know you shared your how you did it afterwards on slack. Is there any? I was looking through the exercise to see if there was a way to like. See the query of like, how you got the

346
000:32:02.210 --> 000:32:12.520
Jack C: so the rank in see? If, like the Rankin was what I thought it was. Is there like a way to do that? Or is it just the way that the data was shared? I kind of don't get that oversight

347
000:32:12.880 --> 000:32:25.069
Jack C: as in. Where would you go to look if these queries exist. Yeah, to see like what you'd done to calculate it like. Well, so I was doing the exercise cause. I read that you like in a meeting. So I was like.

348
000:32:25.410 --> 000:32:26.190
if

349
000:32:26.590 --> 000:32:31.150
Jack C: is there a way to see that whilst you're kind of doing it inside of afterwards?

350
000:32:31.800 --> 000:32:36.020
Jack C: So it is dependent on the person who wrote the query.

351
000:32:36.390 --> 000:32:43.449
Jack C: saving it in a certain way.  give me a second. We're just hopping into bigquery.

352
000:32:44.400 --> 000:32:47.400
Jack C: Give me a wave when you can see

353
000:32:47.880 --> 000:32:49.570
Jack C: what is actually an error message.

354
000:32:49.590 --> 000:32:51.070
Jack C: Lovely? Thank you.

355
000:32:51.380 --> 000:32:52.250
Steph Wright: So

356
000:32:52.580 --> 000:32:55.819
Steph Wright: in here, underneath your

357
000:32:56.080 --> 000:32:57.739
Steph Wright: project title.

358
000:32:57.950 --> 000:33:02.839
Steph Wright: before you start to get your datasets there will be a saved queries

359
000:33:02.980 --> 000:33:05.390
Steph Wright: Bit. If you open that up

360
000:33:05.490 --> 000:33:10.509
Steph Wright: you'll see anything that has been saved in a format that you can view.

361
000:33:11.190 --> 000:33:17.570
Steph Wright: and that's where my code was the entire time

362
000:33:18.360 --> 000:33:19.050
to.

363
000:33:19.360 --> 000:33:32.889
Steph Wright: You didn't have the name of the query, so it was hard to find. You can when it the way that I share them with you is I just go there and click copy link. But best thing to do. Go to project queries.

364
000:33:33.330 --> 000:33:34.319
take a look.

365
000:33:34.500 --> 000:33:41.310
Steph Wright: and if the person, even if the person is in a meeting, quick, slack message of Don't suppose you've got the query.

366
000:33:43.320 --> 000:33:45.180
Steph Wright: and then, if they can.

367
000:33:45.600 --> 000:33:49.340
Steph Wright: they will get that to you in the way I said, like just clicking

368
000:33:49.420 --> 000:33:52.380
Steph Wright: or resaving it as public. If it wasn't public.

369
000:33:52.720 --> 000:33:54.900
Steph Wright: and then getting out to you.

370
000:33:56.360 --> 000:33:59.500
Steph Wright: Alex, you've been very patient with me. Thank you.

371
000:34:00.040 --> 000:34:00.980
Alex Kononov: No problem

372
000:34:01.700 --> 000:34:10.670
my question is, actually not about this particular exercise, but about the general framework. General approach. If you want

373
000:34:11.010 --> 000:34:19.379
Alex Kononov: the table that's you have created with your query that we didn't see

374
000:34:19.550 --> 000:34:30.079
Alex Kononov: and that was found by Peter did not have any information regarding the period to reach this, the results of this query related

375
000:34:30.560 --> 000:34:35.169
Alex Kononov: so to what extent? So was it

376
000:34:35.389 --> 000:34:45.470
Alex Kononov: wise to use the information in the form of a magic table that came from the magic land of we do not know where and how.

377
000:34:48.100 --> 000:34:48.840
Steph Wright: So

378
000:34:49.860 --> 000:34:57.129
Steph Wright: does anybody remember my joining the Doc session? And I told you that a really easy way to filter was to do an in a join

379
000:34:57.600 --> 000:34:59.010
Steph Wright: to another table.

380
000:34:59.850 --> 000:35:03.629
Steph Wright: That's where the table fiscal quarters came in

381
000:35:04.030 --> 000:35:08.470
Steph Wright: when creating the base table. I set it

382
000:35:08.850 --> 000:35:10.260
Steph Wright: to when I want it there.

383
000:35:10.390 --> 000:35:13.480
Steph Wright: So I actually did the filter on the date at this point.

384
000:35:14.120 --> 000:35:15.969
Alex Kononov: I know a different way.

385
000:35:16.000 --> 000:35:35.189
Alex Kononov: Sorry I mean the every seller rank table does not contain any information regarding the date, so it it could be quarter 2 of 2,022, or it could be quarter one quarter 3, the annual, or just daily, on a very good good day for everyone.

386
000:35:35.320 --> 000:35:47.390
Alex Kononov: So this is why I actually started to avoid using it. But I don't know, after all. I verified it was the same. So

387
000:35:47.410 --> 000:35:50.950
I'm asking myself if they do the right thing or not.

388
000:35:51.950 --> 000:35:58.499
Steph Wright: So it comes down to the purpose of what you're writing the code, for if

389
000:35:58.730 --> 000:36:03.270
Steph Wright: I was designing a dashboard so that I could look at that number

390
000:36:04.220 --> 000:36:08.170
Steph Wright: or that information every month or every quarter.

391
000:36:08.190 --> 000:36:14.350
Steph Wright: then the table that I created would have had columns regarding sorry containing date

392
000:36:14.440 --> 000:36:21.470
Steph Wright: or the quarter number something like that, so that I could then use it and manipulate it in my dashboard with a slicer.

393
000:36:22.390 --> 000:36:27.080
Steph Wright: whereas because this was a one-off request, this is where we get to be lazy

394
000:36:27.860 --> 000:36:32.990
Steph Wright: or efficient. it was just like all I need is this, bang in.

395
000:36:33.730 --> 000:36:34.859
Steph Wright: off I go.

396
000:36:35.730 --> 000:36:42.710
Steph Wright: And so it's thinking again, is someone else going to need to use the code? Is it going to be used for something where the data is continually getting

397
000:36:42.730 --> 000:36:49.500
Steph Wright: bigger, or you're getting additional fields. In that case, hard coding stuff like that bad idea.

398
000:36:50.690 --> 000:36:52.139
Steph Wright: Keep your columns

399
000:36:52.590 --> 000:36:58.580
Steph Wright: and then do a where statement right at the very end. or filter it in power. Bi.

400
000:36:58.640 --> 000:37:03.980
Steph Wright: if you had that reseller's ranked table, you actually didn't have to write any sequel.

401
000:37:05.170 --> 000:37:12.260
Steph Wright: You just had to punt it in to power bi and stick a filter on it where the rank is less than 11.

402
000:37:15.290 --> 000:37:18.510
Steph Wright: It's very easy to over-engineer

403
000:37:19.120 --> 000:37:24.730
Steph Wright: things, because we think that the simple way can't possibly be true.

404
000:37:24.850 --> 000:37:28.940
Steph Wright: Alex, you did the right thing. You said I got the same number

405
000:37:29.220 --> 000:37:31.170
Steph Wright: bye. race.

406
000:37:31.850 --> 000:37:37.750
Steph Wright: So that's checking it. If you've got the time like Jack did go through code it up

407
000:37:37.880 --> 000:37:39.860
Steph Wright: and just sense, check it.

408
000:37:40.090 --> 000:37:44.739
Steph Wright: or if you're in an office, and especially if you're in an office in person.

409
000:37:44.980 --> 000:37:52.559
Steph Wright: go to the person you know is good at this stuff. I'll be like Pete. how's Borey for a sec?

410
000:37:53.090 --> 000:38:06.409
Steph Wright: Get them to sense, check the value of the number if they've been in the company longer. If they've worked with the data more than you, they will have a rough idea of certainly the magnitude

411
000:38:06.730 --> 000:38:08.030
Steph Wright: of things.

412
000:38:09.460 --> 000:38:16.049
Steph Wright: So if you were to have calculated profit, and it had come out at like 700 billion

413
000:38:16.320 --> 000:38:17.820
Steph Wright: for one person.

414
000:38:18.200 --> 000:38:20.370
Steph Wright: I'd have probably gone

415
000:38:20.840 --> 000:38:24.900
Steph Wright: Think we've probably used a cross join like Steph has done before, where we shouldn't.

416
000:38:25.640 --> 000:38:27.489
Steph Wright: Let's just go and check with someone.

417
000:38:28.790 --> 000:38:31.530
Steph Wright: Nothing wrong with doing that.

418
000:38:31.780 --> 000:38:34.989
Steph Wright: If there's no one there to check with, it's called.

419
000:38:35.020 --> 000:38:36.879
Steph Wright: Has anybody heard of rubber ducking.

420
000:38:39.780 --> 000:38:40.480
Steph Wright: Hello.

421
000:38:41.040 --> 000:38:48.200
Steph Wright: rubber ducking where you have an inanimate object, preferably a rubber duck, because who doesn't smile when they see their little yellow faces

422
000:38:48.420 --> 000:38:52.070
Steph Wright: that you explain the problem to that you question.

423
000:38:52.810 --> 000:39:01.590
Steph Wright: and it's in that process of chatting away. You get yourself to the answer because you go. No, wait a minute.

424
000:39:02.050 --> 000:39:04.170
Steph Wright: There's there's no way. It's that high

425
000:39:04.720 --> 000:39:05.500
Steph Wright: or

426
000:39:06.470 --> 000:39:12.389
Steph Wright: 120%. No wait. This is definitely a hundred percent maximum type thing.

427
000:39:13.080 --> 000:39:18.939
Steph Wright: So in the absence of another human. An animal will do a rubber duck.

428
000:39:19.440 --> 000:39:25.610
Steph Wright: Any other thing you like to talk at, that you don't really respect. Expect a response to? Well.

429
000:39:25.630 --> 000:39:29.399
Steph Wright: I am mixing up words left right and sent today. I do apologise.

430
000:39:31.010 --> 000:39:32.040
Steph Wright: Yes, my dad

431
000:39:33.090 --> 000:39:57.959
Alex Kononov: no. Just wanted to say that's after all. Even though I've checked. But I've checked the Uk side of the table. It was okay. But my U.S.A. part was absolutely sq, because for some reason the locations other than California did not load up. So I have top 10 in California. U.S.A.'s.

432
000:39:58.510 --> 000:40:04.080
Alex Kononov: After all, the simplest way was the issue. I wanted someone to bring this up.

433
000:40:04.750 --> 000:40:05.600
Steph Wright: So

434
000:40:07.220 --> 000:40:11.849
Steph Wright: the other 2 locations I'm pretty sure one was Denver was the other one. New York.

435
000:40:13.060 --> 000:40:16.739
Steph Wright: Okay. Is that in the Us. Or the U.S.A. So the Us. Or the Uk.

436
000:40:19.090 --> 000:40:19.970
Steph Wright: Anyone.

437
000:40:23.110 --> 000:40:25.960
Steph Wright: California? Where is it?

438
000:40:26.290 --> 000:40:27.019
Is it?

439
000:40:27.370 --> 000:40:28.790
Elymma Mensah: Thank you.

440
000:40:29.260 --> 000:40:30.340
Steph Wright: In the Us.

441
000:40:31.520 --> 000:40:37.040
Steph Wright: You could fill in those gaps. and then you would have been able to split by both region

442
000:40:37.090 --> 000:40:52.150
Steph Wright: and sub region, and you you should get the same answer. So I would just go through. And because you know that the only gaps are US. States. The reason, you know that is, I'm telling you you don't need to go and check the data. It is only those 2 that are missing.

443
000:40:52.500 --> 000:40:56.880
Steph Wright: You could fill it in going. If there's a gap punt in us.

444
000:40:57.590 --> 000:41:01.530
Steph Wright: If it's more nuanced, you might need to use an if statement.

445
000:41:01.860 --> 000:41:13.540
Steph Wright: If there's 2 options or a case select statement. those are the easiest ways of doing it, especially if it's information that, you know, like it has to be true.

446
000:41:13.640 --> 000:41:16.900
Steph Wright: If California and its region is us.

447
000:41:17.190 --> 000:41:23.870
Steph Wright: then the same must be true for other US. States. But when presenting this, what do we do?

448
000:41:25.190 --> 000:41:26.370
Steph Wright: Free words?

449
000:41:26.460 --> 000:41:28.180
Steph Wright: We've said these to you quite a lot

450
000:41:29.320 --> 000:41:31.110
state our assumptions.

451
000:41:32.130 --> 000:41:38.899
Steph Wright: We state our assumptions. So it's I've split this out by the US. And the UK. But just so you're aware.

452
000:41:39.150 --> 000:41:41.569
Steph Wright: I had to fill in or backfill

453
000:41:41.650 --> 000:41:43.570
Steph Wright: the the region fields

454
000:41:43.860 --> 000:41:52.549
Steph Wright: because they were empty for Denver and New York. No one's going to question that right. That makes a hundred percent of sense.

455
000:41:52.570 --> 000:41:54.709
Steph Wright: But if you don't tell them that.

456
000:41:54.760 --> 000:41:57.559
Steph Wright: and then they find out that that's what you did.

457
000:41:57.880 --> 000:42:02.700
Steph Wright: It incorrectly makes them assume that you did something a bit, squinty.

458
000:42:03.880 --> 000:42:07.519
Steph Wright: because when things appear to have been hidden.

459
000:42:07.850 --> 000:42:12.099
Steph Wright: People question them all. whereas if you shine a light on a problem

460
000:42:12.330 --> 000:42:14.710
Steph Wright: or an assumption, everyone's like

461
000:42:15.200 --> 000:42:20.709
Steph Wright: lovely, because they can then incorporate that. Yes, this is another cover you're asked.

462
000:42:20.750 --> 000:42:30.700
Steph Wright: really, but I'm playing with the finer points again of like manipulating your audience. Remember, if you share what you've done.

463
000:42:31.450 --> 000:42:33.199
Steph Wright: people don't question the details.

464
000:42:35.290 --> 000:42:36.369
Steph Wright: so I get through life.

465
000:42:38.130 --> 000:42:43.139
Steph Wright: It does look a little bit thin, like you're saying goodbye in a really kind of

466
000:42:43.160 --> 000:42:45.750
Steph Wright: flamboyant fashion in the chat.

467
000:42:46.990 --> 000:42:52.680
Steph Wright: I am at your disposal. Everyone it's kind of like. Ask me the things

468
000:42:52.980 --> 000:43:00.209
Steph Wright: it it we're getting to the point now where, if it's about the the technical stuff. I will start fielding those questions because we seem to be.

469
000:43:00.330 --> 000:43:03.950
Steph Wright: you know, slowing down, I'm losing more and more people off camera.

470
000:43:04.110 --> 000:43:06.889
Steph Wright: I can see you all I know. Who's this at bed.

471
000:43:08.010 --> 000:43:13.389
Steph Wright: Sherri Shiri. I was like, there's a really small people who are carrying you everyone

472
000:43:13.730 --> 000:43:14.450
Steph Wright: bye.

473
000:43:14.740 --> 000:43:23.020
Steph Wright: I may not be able to pick on you in this session because it's not a taught one. But don't think I won't next time.

474
000:43:23.620 --> 000:43:27.470
Steph Wright:  And don't forget. Shall we?

475
000:43:27.670 --> 000:43:37.420
Shiri: This might not be helpful to everyone. So I'm sorry, but my sequel isn't great, and I can't figure out

476
000:43:38.390 --> 000:43:41.889
Shiri: the ranking resellers. Do you mind talking us through it?

477
000:43:42.850 --> 000:43:47.599
Steph Wright: I can do. Let me just see if Alex has a different type of question and get that

478
000:43:47.660 --> 000:43:49.000
Steph Wright: query open.

479
000:43:49.700 --> 000:43:54.450
Steph Wright: And yeah, it's just a small remark about assumptions.

480
000:43:54.490 --> 000:44:06.389
Alex Kononov: The thing is that's if it's were anything else but Denver, for example, for the U.S.A. I would feel absolutely safe. But the thing is that's there is Denver in Uk. So

481
000:44:08.520 --> 000:44:12.830
GC Storino: I didn't know neither. I'm gonna be 100. There's also a London in the U.S.A. so

482
000:44:12.860 --> 000:44:19.410
Alex Kononov: absolutely. And there are about 30 or 40 Saint Petersburgs there. So Pepper.

483
000:44:20.160 --> 000:44:26.049
Steph Wright: the making assumptions can be dangerous. But at least, if you state it

484
000:44:26.390 --> 000:44:29.559
Steph Wright: any conclusions that you make based on that

485
000:44:29.610 --> 000:44:37.210
Steph Wright: right if it comes back to it. And they're like, How could you be so stupid? We clearly meant Denver in the UK. And you'd be like.

486
000:44:37.540 --> 000:44:39.889
Steph Wright: okay, so remember that slide deck.

487
000:44:40.270 --> 000:44:41.759
Steph Wright: Remember, I told you

488
000:44:42.310 --> 000:44:45.270
Steph Wright: right that that was your moment

489
000:44:45.530 --> 000:44:46.770
Steph Wright: to bring up

490
000:44:46.860 --> 000:44:57.730
Steph Wright: that the numbers weren't quite right, because we could have gone away, I could have read other things. Please don't be this combative about it right. I am not at my best in terms of charming people today.

491
000:44:57.910 --> 000:45:04.099
Steph Wright: but it's that's why we stay our assumptions. And that is why, preferably, those assumptions

492
000:45:04.210 --> 000:45:14.010
Steph Wright: are in a slide deck somewhere, or in the report you sent out. They are written so essentially. If you send it out, people don't come back and go. No.

493
000:45:14.900 --> 000:45:15.970
Steph Wright: This signed off.

494
000:45:17.620 --> 000:45:18.470
Jc.

495
000:45:21.130 --> 000:45:33.940
GC Storino: yeah, you could just do a quick check with the postal addresses, because the postal code will usually tell you the state and everything that's in  It's a bit. It's also a bit strange that you had California and New York, and then Denver.

496
000:45:34.330 --> 000:45:35.979
GC Storino: like 2 State. Well.

497
000:45:37.440 --> 000:45:43.070
GC Storino: if I'm with 2 cities and one state. It's a bit weird for categorization.

498
000:45:43.510 --> 000:45:47.209
Steph Wright: You just weren't. Well, obviously, II took a subset

499
000:45:47.370 --> 000:45:48.690
Steph Wright: of a dataset.

500
000:45:48.740 --> 000:45:49.990
Steph Wright: We went with it.

501
000:45:50.010 --> 000:46:09.860
Steph Wright: So that's probably why it's a bit. But again, these are the sorts of things that when you're digging through the data like you hopefully wouldn't have it. Under such time pressure you could go. You could ask the person who sent the request. You could ask the data owner. The person whose name comes up next to created by

502
000:46:10.000 --> 000:46:14.529
Steph Wright: in bigquery and be like, I just wanna check what the logic was

503
000:46:14.640 --> 000:46:19.570
Steph Wright: of having this information at different levels.

504
000:46:20.610 --> 000:46:21.390
GC Storino: Fairness.

505
000:46:22.620 --> 000:46:23.310
GC Storino: Yeah.

506
000:46:24.300 --> 000:46:26.849
Steph Wright: Still to the bigquery.

507
000:46:30.180 --> 000:46:44.889
Steph Wright: So what I'm going to need you do. I've tried to make it nice and big. I know I'm on a laptop screen, for which I apologize. Let me know the row number, or is it just the whole thing like, where is the problem coming up? So I make sure I'm talking about the right thing

508
000:46:45.950 --> 000:46:55.230
Shiri: it was mainly the stuff under select that was confusing me. Yeah, from like 3 to 10.

509
000:46:56.140 --> 000:46:56.900
Steph Wright: Okay.

510
000:46:57.160 --> 000:47:00.410
Steph Wright: so we'll take some of the the easier ones

511
000:47:00.560 --> 000:47:01.650
Steph Wright: hopefully.

512
000:47:02.020 --> 000:47:03.610
Steph Wright: which would be

513
000:47:05.000 --> 000:47:06.269
Steph Wright: these little ones.

514
000:47:06.280 --> 000:47:07.840
Steph Wright: Yeah, in pink.

515
000:47:08.560 --> 000:47:09.450
Steph Wright: And

516
000:47:10.760 --> 000:47:11.760
Steph Wright: these here.

517
000:47:12.660 --> 000:47:15.720
Steph Wright: all this is doing is going

518
000:47:15.750 --> 000:47:16.780
Steph Wright: Sequo.

519
000:47:17.140 --> 000:47:19.770
Steph Wright: The column I want is in the table.

520
000:47:20.130 --> 000:47:23.699
Steph Wright: DE. Please pull building number from there

521
000:47:23.770 --> 000:47:31.519
Steph Wright: and pop it in this column. The next one same table subregion line 7 postcode, and then total profit

522
000:47:31.810 --> 000:47:35.220
Steph Wright: is from a different table. So that's why

523
000:47:35.490 --> 000:47:36.790
Steph Wright: those bits

524
000:47:36.830 --> 000:47:39.309
Steph Wright: are there, are we? Good? With that I just figured I'll

525
000:47:39.520 --> 000:47:42.000
Steph Wright: start at the beginning. Right? Let's get rid of it.

526
000:47:43.880 --> 000:47:45.570
Steph Wright: Okay, let's look at this one

527
000:47:47.350 --> 000:47:51.559
Steph Wright: show. We have an if function in here.

528
000:47:51.730 --> 000:47:59.459
Steph Wright: part of a concatenation. So all a concatenation does is pull together strings

529
000:48:00.260 --> 000:48:01.809
Steph Wright: with a separator

530
000:48:03.020 --> 000:48:03.850
Steph Wright: in that.

531
000:48:04.070 --> 000:48:06.719
Steph Wright: So we've got. Please give me the first name

532
000:48:06.980 --> 000:48:11.730
Steph Wright: with a space. and then the last name, and this is exactly

533
000:48:12.120 --> 000:48:14.029
Steph Wright: as it is for

534
000:48:14.310 --> 000:48:18.129
Steph Wright: pulling in things like total profit. It's just

535
000:48:18.150 --> 000:48:19.430
Steph Wright: the table name.

536
000:48:20.650 --> 000:48:21.869
Steph Wright: and the first name

537
000:48:24.550 --> 000:48:25.580
Steph Wright: prefix

538
000:48:26.330 --> 000:48:32.129
Steph Wright: all the prefixes is Mr. Mrs. Dr. Professor.

539
000:48:32.530 --> 000:48:37.870
Steph Wright: but sometimes we don't hold that data and it in these tables.

540
000:48:38.050 --> 000:48:48.439
Steph Wright: That data was represented by a null value. What we didn't want to do was make SQL. Fall over when trying to concatenate in

541
000:48:49.130 --> 000:48:53.799
Steph Wright: the prefix with the first name and the second name.

542
000:48:54.560 --> 000:49:01.290
Steph Wright: So we just go. Okay, let me get rid of my lines because we're getting messy now, hey? Working on our laptop screen. Stupid hit

543
000:49:01.740 --> 000:49:06.450
Steph Wright: is going. Please go and have a look at the value of prefix.

544
000:49:07.130 --> 000:49:11.750
Steph Wright: if it's null. replace it with nothing.

545
000:49:12.410 --> 000:49:18.010
Steph Wright: so that there is no space, no null, anything like that sat in front of

546
000:49:20.200 --> 000:49:23.479
Steph Wright: their first name when we're pulling their full name.

547
000:49:23.510 --> 000:49:25.240
Steph Wright: put on the address label

548
000:49:26.760 --> 000:49:28.589
Steph Wright: after you've done that, if function

549
000:49:29.360 --> 000:49:33.430
Steph Wright: stick in first name, stick in the space stick in the last name.

550
000:49:34.030 --> 000:49:40.239
Steph Wright: So this one, when you're building it up, you do not start with the overall concatenation.

551
000:49:40.370 --> 000:49:44.099
Steph Wright: You think right. What it? What does my thing look like

552
000:49:44.770 --> 000:49:45.770
Steph Wright: prefix

553
000:49:46.010 --> 000:49:50.700
Steph Wright: birth, name, last name. How would that look if I just smudged it together?

554
000:49:50.790 --> 000:49:52.629
Steph Wright: Wait! I need some spaces.

555
000:49:53.050 --> 000:49:55.529
Steph Wright: and then you probably would have run that code

556
000:49:56.250 --> 000:50:01.379
Steph Wright: and seen that there was a null value or gaps that were causing problems

557
000:50:01.990 --> 000:50:07.999
Steph Wright: for the people that didn't have that prefix. And then you'd go back and fix it with the if function.

558
000:50:08.190 --> 000:50:10.200
Steph Wright: because that is exactly what I did

559
000:50:10.740 --> 000:50:19.140
Steph Wright: in order to get there. I couldn't write this starting at line one and going through tip, tapping this code.

560
000:50:19.210 --> 000:50:20.760
Steph Wright: Not a chance.

561
000:50:21.240 --> 000:50:22.010
It's

562
000:50:22.540 --> 000:50:25.150
Steph Wright: this is where I started

563
000:50:26.740 --> 000:50:28.550
Steph Wright: just getting that information.

564
000:50:28.960 --> 000:50:32.150
Steph Wright: Then I moved on and did the bigger bits.

565
000:50:32.960 --> 000:50:35.179
Steph Wright: everyone will write their code differently.

566
000:50:37.090 --> 000:50:43.169
Steph Wright: Second. I probably should have started with this one because it's an easier example of an F function.

567
000:50:44.170 --> 000:50:48.179
Steph Wright: All that's going is the same thing. If there isn't a region.

568
000:50:48.650 --> 000:50:49.999
Steph Wright: put in U.S.A.

569
000:50:50.850 --> 000:50:58.079
Steph Wright: Because I've gone through. I've looked at the data, and I'm like all the gaps should be U.S.A. easy. If not.

570
000:50:58.310 --> 000:51:00.379
Steph Wright: give me the actual

571
000:51:01.170 --> 000:51:03.350
Steph Wright: region that's in the table.

572
000:51:04.180 --> 000:51:13.999
Steph Wright: And then, just to make sure that we don't get a weird like F one column name, because we're doing some sort of, you know. Cleverness.

573
000:51:14.830 --> 000:51:16.530
Steph Wright: Just make sure you got that in there.

574
000:51:17.040 --> 000:51:21.240
Steph Wright: Sometimes it makes difference. Sometimes it doesn't just pretty good practice.

575
000:51:22.730 --> 000:51:25.790
Steph Wright: And then we get to the one that you were dreading right?

576
000:51:26.110 --> 000:51:29.869
Steph Wright: Almost anticipating the window functions.

577
000:51:29.880 --> 000:51:38.120
Steph Wright: I'm gonna be honest with you. These are doing exactly the same thing as each other. So what we're going to do is we're just going to get rid of

578
000:51:38.400 --> 000:51:41.579
Steph Wright: this one with the world's straightest line

579
000:51:43.910 --> 000:51:48.730
Steph Wright: check. Well, we've got a window function. The first thing we see

580
000:51:49.330 --> 000:51:55.350
Steph Wright: is the actual function, the clever thing that we want SQL. To do.

581
000:51:55.450 --> 000:51:57.389
Steph Wright: We want it to rank.

582
000:51:58.360 --> 000:52:03.010
Steph Wright: Some of the people are salespeople, buy a certain thing.

583
000:52:04.510 --> 000:52:10.280
Steph Wright: and so what I did when I wrote this out. No word of a lie is, I went rank

584
000:52:10.370 --> 000:52:12.589
Steph Wright: over, and then I googled

585
000:52:13.800 --> 000:52:20.130
Steph Wright: and over to make sure I got the next bits in the correct order, which was partitioned by, and then I put a space

586
000:52:20.490 --> 000:52:22.990
Steph Wright: order by, and then I put a space.

587
000:52:24.210 --> 000:52:27.850
Steph Wright: and then I close my brackets. because

588
000:52:28.080 --> 000:52:32.770
Steph Wright: as soon as you think about it in English, you know where to fill the gaps.

589
000:52:33.370 --> 000:52:37.299
Steph Wright: So I want to split my data by subregion.

590
000:52:38.630 --> 000:52:41.120
Steph Wright: That is what we partition by.

591
000:52:41.160 --> 000:52:43.150
Steph Wright: and if the gap is already there.

592
000:52:43.270 --> 000:52:46.849
Steph Wright: After copying and pasting what this template

593
000:52:46.890 --> 000:52:54.619
Steph Wright: of a window function looks like. You know exactly what to pop in. And then it's okay. What am I ranking them by

594
000:52:55.060 --> 000:52:56.839
Steph Wright: their total profit?

595
000:52:57.900 --> 000:53:00.580
Steph Wright: How do I calculate? Total profit in SQL.

596
000:53:00.760 --> 000:53:03.200
Steph Wright: I do a sum profit

597
000:53:05.460 --> 000:53:06.460
Steph Wright: fill in the gap.

598
000:53:07.770 --> 000:53:10.249
Steph Wright: and then it's do I want the top

599
000:53:10.670 --> 000:53:14.069
Steph Wright: number of these, or do I want the bottom?

600
000:53:14.940 --> 000:53:16.929
Steph Wright: If we're looking at the best.

601
000:53:16.940 --> 000:53:26.430
Steph Wright: and we're talking about profit. then we tell it. Please arrange my numbers, starting with the biggest and going down to the smallest.

602
000:53:26.540 --> 000:53:31.260
Steph Wright: which is what allows you to do the less than 11 filter

603
000:53:31.640 --> 000:53:33.000
Steph Wright: in power Bi.

604
000:53:35.070 --> 000:53:40.370
Steph Wright: And need you to tell me, Teri, is that a bit clearer, is it not?

605
000:53:40.480 --> 000:53:43.969
Shiri: No, that makes a lot of sense. But now I have a new question.

606
000:53:44.720 --> 000:53:53.699
Shiri: Okay, hit me. No one else is put the hand up. So you have the floor. Do you have to do it as less than 11, cause I think I did it by

607
000:53:55.670 --> 000:54:01.629
Shiri: self string by top end. And then just 10. Yep, that's fine. Okay, cool.

608
000:54:02.360 --> 000:54:06.009
Steph Wright: That's using one of power. Bi. It's lovely in built

609
000:54:06.390 --> 000:54:08.449
Steph Wright: features to do that.

610
000:54:09.160 --> 000:54:20.629
Steph Wright: The the reason I like a filter buy with the inequality is, it means that if I want to start getting more specific in how I'm cutting things down. It's very easy for me to go in shift stuff about

611
000:54:20.770 --> 000:54:21.710
Steph Wright: and do it.

612
000:54:22.150 --> 000:54:28.530
Steph Wright: but it's it's totally your call. How you approach it. As long as you were getting out

613
000:54:28.760 --> 000:54:30.149
Steph Wright: 10 people.

614
000:54:33.430 --> 000:54:36.359
Steph Wright: you could also do this with row number. By the way.

615
000:54:37.910 --> 000:54:40.499
Steph Wright: row number stops any duplications of number.

616
000:54:44.680 --> 000:54:51.839
Steph Wright: I mean, you've got 6 min. I can let you go. You can ask me another question. We can check in and see if you hate me more or less

617
000:54:52.350 --> 000:54:55.760
Steph Wright: at the end of this session. Who knows Jack

618
000:54:56.270 --> 000:54:57.339
Jack C: like a whippet

619
000:54:57.640 --> 000:55:01.920
Jack C: on on that query you just shout in

620
000:55:02.690 --> 000:55:10.869
Jack C: is it? I know you said 2 links is the other one where you you did it by the quarter. Where's the I can't see the

621
000:55:11.150 --> 000:55:14.520
Jack C: water to 2021. Was that like a second?

622
000:55:14.640 --> 000:55:18.089
Jack C: 2 s? Yeah. So ranking resellers

623
000:55:18.430 --> 000:55:24.919
Jack C: this one here with the window functions in. That's the one that to get the final table.

624
000:55:25.690 --> 000:55:27.360
Jack C: But it's using

625
000:55:27.560 --> 000:55:29.399
Steph Wright: this query here.

626
000:55:29.570 --> 000:55:31.360
Steph Wright: pulling together the data.

627
000:55:31.960 --> 000:55:35.669
Jack C: Oh, access tonight. Why is my access denied?

628
000:55:36.100 --> 000:55:37.200
Shouldn't be.

629
000:55:37.350 --> 000:55:39.140
Jack C: Let me have a look at that.

630
000:55:40.520 --> 000:55:41.749
Jack C: This is the one.

631
000:55:41.920 --> 000:55:44.740
Jack C: and it's just where you've got your

632
000:55:45.640 --> 000:55:48.059
Jack C: in a join to that

633
000:55:48.330 --> 000:55:51.029
Jack C: fiscal's quarter table, because if you

634
000:55:51.990 --> 000:55:53.770
Jack C: then stick in your where?

635
000:55:53.920 --> 000:55:58.560
Jack C: What is that error? Sorry. annoying me now

636
000:55:58.880 --> 000:56:04.250
the rank in resellers calls from this query, pulling together the data.

637
000:56:04.700 --> 000:56:05.490
Jack C: Yes.

638
000:56:05.850 --> 000:56:08.930
Jack C: So if we go into more

639
000:56:09.440 --> 000:56:11.170
Jack C: query settings.

640
000:56:12.120 --> 000:56:13.279
give it a second.

641
000:56:14.240 --> 000:56:16.790
Jack C: If this was actually allowing me to do the thing.

642
000:56:18.070 --> 000:56:23.209
Steph Wright: I set the destination table. Picked the dataset

643
000:56:24.590 --> 000:56:26.230
Steph Wright: that it was in. If you start

644
000:56:26.250 --> 000:56:29.200
Steph Wright: typing it out. pick that one.

645
000:56:29.510 --> 000:56:33.810
Steph Wright: And then I typed in Reseller's ranked, or whatever I called the table

646
000:56:34.530 --> 000:56:39.619
Steph Wright: click, save. And then when I ran that query. It created the table

647
000:56:39.780 --> 000:56:41.339
Steph Wright: where it was pre-filtered

648
000:56:44.800 --> 000:56:55.720
Jack C: and query, I'm gonna have to dig into that and find out what's going. Cause this worked like it clearly produced to the table because it was there for you. It is the query that did the job.

649
000:56:56.110 --> 000:56:57.740
Steph Wright: not the tidied up. One

650
000:56:59.430 --> 000:57:00.200
Steph Wright: same.

651
000:57:00.390 --> 000:57:06.960
Steph Wright: I am seeing a lot of glazed eyes, crazy eyes. some faces, and some fidgeting like

652
000:57:07.060 --> 000:57:14.779
Steph Wright: I think it's time for you guys to go have a stretch, maybe caffeinate. Get some sugar in you ahead of Team Trivia.

653
000:57:15.950 --> 000:57:18.269
Steph Wright: Oh, yes. I've not forgotten.

654
000:57:19.090 --> 000:57:27.789
Steph Wright: So unless you have any other questions, I'm going to bid you at you. Thank you very much for engaging this with me. This has probably been one of the most spirited

655
000:57:28.220 --> 000:57:36.039
Steph Wright: discussions I've had that didn't come from you hating me as a group. so I'd say it's one of the more positive ones from my point of view. So thanks

656
000:57:39.110 --> 000:57:39.960
Steph Wright: bye.

657
000:57:40.600 --> 000:57:42.620
Florine: thank you. Aye.

658
000:57:43.480 --> 000:57:45.359
Elymma Mensah: thank you. Bye.
