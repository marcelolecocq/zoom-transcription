1
000:00:02.050 --> 000:00:03.280
Eben Uys: There we go.

2
000:00:04.330 --> 000:00:06.620
Eben Uys: Okay. So

3
000:00:07.470 --> 000:00:11.880
Eben Uys: first things. First, let's do an emotional check in

4
000:00:12.130 --> 000:00:15.730
Eben Uys: on a scale of one to 10, one

5
000:00:15.810 --> 000:00:20.609
Eben Uys: closer to negative emotions. So anger, frustration. You know.

6
000:00:20.730 --> 000:00:26.339
Eben Uys: if I was sitting next to you currently, you probably would have slapped me, or at least tell me where to go

7
000:00:26.970 --> 000:00:30.979
Eben Uys: in very, very strong language, or 10

8
000:00:31.290 --> 000:00:32.409
Eben Uys: positive

9
000:00:32.549 --> 000:00:35.330
Eben Uys: emotions like excitement.

10
000:00:35.450 --> 000:00:38.049
Eben Uys: feeling good about what you saw.

11
000:00:38.640 --> 000:00:41.109
Eben Uys: Use the chat. Give me a number.

12
000:00:45.890 --> 000:00:49.949
Eben Uys: I'm not gonna talk to Sonya in this one there.

13
000:00:54.510 --> 000:00:56.850
Eben Uys: Okay, so we have a lot of middle.

14
000:01:01.300 --> 000:01:07.709
Eben Uys: We have a lot of people on the middle side of things, couple of threes and fours. Okay, so

15
000:01:09.940 --> 000:01:14.759
Eben Uys: GCI gotta avoid GC as well on this one, I think, yeah.

16
000:01:15.110 --> 000:01:17.870
Eben Uys: Okay. said again.

17
000:01:18.010 --> 000:01:21.169
Eben Uys: the purpose of the fire drills is

18
000:01:22.360 --> 000:01:28.090
Eben Uys: give you a time box activity to sort of taste some of your skills. Are you gonna get it right?

19
000:01:28.600 --> 000:01:31.560
Eben Uys: Maybe. But they are really hard

20
000:01:32.170 --> 000:01:33.770
Eben Uys: at the time pressure.

21
000:01:33.990 --> 000:01:40.450
Eben Uys: And a lot of the sequel just sort of falls out of your age, right? So they are challenging.

22
000:01:40.970 --> 000:01:41.920
Eben Uys: But

23
000:01:42.140 --> 000:01:45.040
Eben Uys: that's what we're gonna chat through

24
000:01:45.190 --> 000:01:53.320
Eben Uys: in the next half an hour. I'm sort of gonna give you place to share what was really challenging for you.

25
000:01:53.800 --> 000:02:01.970
Eben Uys: We'll chat about the actual deliverable a bit later, because I do want you to submit something, but it shouldn't take

26
000:02:02.710 --> 000:02:10.920
Eben Uys: a lot of your time. But you'll have time tomorrow to, you know. Did it get an hour or a hour or 2 on it? Okay, so

27
000:02:13.940 --> 000:02:18.620
Eben Uys: what? What were some of the main things that you were struggling with ends up.

28
000:02:18.900 --> 000:02:25.250
Eben Uys: Chat to me. What were some of the challenges on this one? Ace, Alex.

29
000:02:28.260 --> 000:02:38.680
Alex Kononov: I had several challenges first of them was just the emotional stress of preparing something that

30
000:02:38.820 --> 000:02:41.899
Alex Kononov: should be okay to look at

31
000:02:41.960 --> 000:03:00.370
Alex Kononov: within the given time frame the second thing was the conversion to percents. because I've made a stupid mistake. I have, multiplied by 100 to to receive the percent in

32
000:03:00.510 --> 000:03:14.739
Alex Kononov: my sequel query, and then I have done the same thing by converting it so to present in excel, to visualize. So I have achieved the unheard of levels of conversion.

33
000:03:15.030 --> 000:03:25.950
Alex Kononov: Yeah, unfortunately, they were not real, but just the need of presenting something in a visually agreeable way. For me. It wasn't

34
000:03:26.020 --> 000:03:27.130
Alex Kononov: great challenge.

35
000:03:28.390 --> 000:03:39.840
Eben Uys: Yes, I think I had a glimpse at yours. It's something in a 76% conversion or something, right? We're always converting everyone. It's coming to our website.  again.

36
000:03:40.630 --> 000:03:50.050
Eben Uys: I am hoping in the workplace that you won't walk into something like this straight off the bat because you don't have a lot of familiarity with the data yet.

37
000:03:50.260 --> 000:03:56.109
Eben Uys: but you can learn something about yourself in terms of in in a business

38
000:03:56.270 --> 000:04:05.439
Eben Uys: context, they are gonna be urgent, short, timeframed requests. And if you're typically a person that really and

39
000:04:05.450 --> 000:04:11.160
Eben Uys: it happened to me in business as well, where you know, sort of the anxiety and stress. Get to you.

40
000:04:11.350 --> 000:04:13.090
Eben Uys: Ask your manager

41
000:04:13.330 --> 000:04:16.730
Eben Uys: to for some help and some

42
000:04:17.390 --> 000:04:29.149
Eben Uys:  you know it's assistance from the rest of the team until you get more comfortable in managing some of those situations. Some people might get to a point where they they really need a lot of

43
000:04:29.640 --> 000:04:39.499
Eben Uys: just support. And you, you know you can deliver good work as long as you have enough time. So that's that's something that you need to learn

44
000:04:39.780 --> 000:04:53.609
Eben Uys: and take from the course as well that if you don't perform that well under time pressure. that is something you can get better at. But some people might never get to a point where they 100% comfortable with it.

45
000:04:53.620 --> 000:05:02.339
Eben Uys: I'll use this an example of. I read a book around. They were interviewing a lot of pilots, commercial airline pilots

46
000:05:02.380 --> 000:05:13.600
Eben Uys: and scenarios that went wrong. Where they've sort of lost an engine, or they had technical failure. and it's I can't remember where this was

47
000:05:14.300 --> 000:05:17.300
Eben Uys: but pilots thrive

48
000:05:17.530 --> 000:05:28.820
Eben Uys: for that day. I realized in reading it they're a different species, because I would be terrified losing one of my 2 engines. Midair

49
000:05:28.950 --> 000:05:42.779
Eben Uys: like that's when they zone in. And they're like. This is what I've trained for. I have the ability to save the day, and it's truly they absolutely do their best work and their best thinking under that amount of pressure.

50
000:05:43.100 --> 000:05:44.550
Eben Uys: That's never gonna be me

51
000:05:45.290 --> 000:05:48.759
Eben Uys: sorry for everyone on the call plane is going down

52
000:05:48.900 --> 000:05:51.850
Eben Uys: if we lose it, and I'm

53
000:05:51.900 --> 000:05:55.420
Eben Uys: the captain of that flight. I'm just going to panic and say, sorry

54
000:05:55.580 --> 000:06:09.039
Eben Uys: hopefully, as a parachute that I could take but definitely. there are some people that are better at managing under stress than others, and but it is a skill that you can cultivate over time to get better at it as well.

55
000:06:09.130 --> 000:06:13.540
Eben Uys: Jack, you add your hand up before Rob, so I'm coming to you next, and they will get to Rob.

56
000:06:15.360 --> 000:06:27.260
Jack C: Hey? I I like got to a point, and II don't even know if it's possible. I feel like in big query. I created like a table which had like

57
000:06:27.310 --> 000:06:30.679
Jack C: who the event outcomes.

58
000:06:31.050 --> 000:06:38.550
Jack C: And then I had like a list that was just of the dates that were in 2021, for like if I could like, put that list

59
000:06:38.620 --> 000:06:47.269
Jack C: that table I'd met into how be I? I would have maybe been able to get something. But I just I don't know if that's possible.

60
000:06:47.720 --> 000:06:49.089
And

61
000:06:49.320 --> 000:06:57.160
Jack C: but that's why I was like II thought I'd be able to do this easier if it was in power Bi, and like to start playing around with some of the tables.

62
000:06:57.840 --> 000:06:58.750
Eben Uys: Yeah.

63
000:06:59.090 --> 000:07:02.980
Jack C: really stupid or or smart.

64
000:07:03.330 --> 000:07:06.749
Eben Uys: No, Jack, that's a great insight, because it is

65
000:07:07.120 --> 000:07:09.969
Eben Uys: what is the tool for this job

66
000:07:10.130 --> 000:07:15.490
Eben Uys: I would have probably state in power Bi. Quick and dirty stuff.

67
000:07:16.120 --> 000:07:35.109
Eben Uys: I would have probably state as much as possible in sequel or in bigquery. the last financing of a results and maybe creating a chart or 2, I would have probably done in excel. But it's just because that is skills that I'm very, very comfortable with, and I can quickly do.

68
000:07:36.030 --> 000:07:41.690
Eben Uys: I've seen previous cowboys that try to attempt this whole exercise in power Bi.

69
000:07:42.740 --> 000:07:43.730
Eben Uys: and

70
000:07:43.910 --> 000:07:55.560
Eben Uys: it can be done. But there's a lot to take into consideration. Yeah, first of all. if you're taking the whole exercise to power bi

71
000:07:56.370 --> 000:08:01.189
Eben Uys: and I'm not saying you've done this, Jack. It's just a general discussion point.

72
000:08:01.600 --> 000:08:10.520
Eben Uys: But if you look at the size of the sessions and the final living stables, they are the 2 biggest tables that prism has in that data warehouse.

73
000:08:12.020 --> 000:08:18.760
Eben Uys: So if you work with tables of that magnitude, you want your biggest processing power

74
000:08:19.240 --> 000:08:20.220
Eben Uys: to

75
000:08:20.420 --> 000:08:35.999
Eben Uys: be used on those tables, right? And that is currently keeping it on Google Cloud to do aggregation and stuff there. This there is a way that you can take it to power Bi. But all of a sudden power bi is on your local machine.

76
000:08:36.230 --> 000:08:47.790
Eben Uys: which means that that processing happens on your local machine. And I've seen a lot of the previous cowards get very frustrated because they say it just keeps on running, and it's not doing anything right.

77
000:08:47.870 --> 000:08:49.980
Eben Uys: So there's definitely

78
000:08:50.230 --> 000:08:51.949
Eben Uys: there's a tool for the job.

79
000:08:52.330 --> 000:09:03.890
Eben Uys: and some of it might be better than others. It also comes down to your own skill. Set, Jack, I would say, if you've done a lot of stuff in of the big aggregations like

80
000:09:04.440 --> 000:09:16.039
Eben Uys: amount of sessions to day of the week or weekday week, and and you sort of had a lot of those big aggregations happening in Google cloud throttle big query

81
000:09:16.120 --> 000:09:22.409
Eben Uys: and then use the power bi for more of this, some calculations and visualization.

82
000:09:22.430 --> 000:09:23.660
Eben Uys: That would have been

83
000:09:23.680 --> 000:09:35.019
Eben Uys: a really good approach. But you can get stuck if you try and do on this specific exercise to to much in power. Bi but we'll get back to that a bit later. It's a good point, Rob.

84
000:09:36.080 --> 000:09:44.169
robmadigan: Even. So yeah, again, I think the timeline was definitely the tricky part for me. So I was trying to like

85
000:09:44.660 --> 000:09:53.020
robmadigan: familiar filler, familiarize myself with the different tables and the different items in it. And, for example, like I,

86
000:09:53.430 --> 000:09:59.129
robmadigan: I should have asked the question to be honest, but II just figured out like I just thought like, Oh, add to cart must mean purchase. Well.

87
000:09:59.200 --> 000:10:04.880
robmadigan: there's no guarantee that even is a purchase. So I just thought but that was what I decided to base my so query on.

88
000:10:04.940 --> 000:10:07.260
robmadigan: I was like, Oh, okay, well.

89
000:10:07.310 --> 000:10:09.559
robmadigan: yeah, mightn't be the case. But yeah.

90
000:10:09.700 --> 000:10:27.910
robmadigan: cause once you're so queries like, once you have your your your data taken from the big query and put it into power. Voi! That's what you're working with. You can't manipulate it really beyond that. So and then I didn't really have much time been in power via to kind of like, figure out how to make this pretty and stuff like. So it's definitely the time element.

91
000:10:28.140 --> 000:10:30.139
robmadigan: It has a good challenge on the same sports.

92
000:10:31.000 --> 000:10:31.890
Eben Uys: Yeah.

93
000:10:33.010 --> 000:10:34.589
Eben Uys: who?

94
000:10:35.390 --> 000:10:40.430
Eben Uys: So in terms of the the approach that people have used it, the majority of you

95
000:10:40.660 --> 000:10:46.360
Eben Uys: stay in big query, or did some people go to power? Bi? What was sort of the

96
000:10:46.400 --> 000:10:49.780
Eben Uys: the approach in terms of it's gc.

97
000:10:51.060 --> 000:10:57.520
GC Storino: I started from Bigquery just to grab the data that I needed slapped into excel, did some

98
000:10:57.910 --> 000:11:01.069
GC Storino: aggregation functions onto it just to.

99
000:11:01.130 --> 000:11:11.039
GC Storino: I think it was just averages and stuff like that, and then put it into power Bi, and just put a bunch of cards up just to make it easier. I probably feel like I've just done the entire like

100
000:11:11.570 --> 000:11:14.660
GC Storino: thought process wrong continued looking at like Robson.

101
000:11:14.970 --> 000:11:17.770
GC Storino: other people's stuff. But that's basically what I did.

102
000:11:18.210 --> 000:11:24.640
Eben Uys: I was about to ask you, why do you have minus 273.0015

103
000:11:25.550 --> 000:11:33.689
GC Storino: that that was your your emotional take in yet that was the joke.

104
000:11:34.240 --> 000:11:37.700
Eben Uys: Okay. So in terms of

105
000:11:39.280 --> 000:11:42.160
Eben Uys: the approach else, Thomas?

106
000:11:43.330 --> 000:11:57.189
Thomas Woo: I'm a big fan of to prepare the data in the funds be before feeding into whatever office for visualization. Yeah, because it's I think, yeah. First of all, it is more

107
000:11:57.210 --> 000:11:58.859
Thomas Woo: easy to do

108
000:11:59.260 --> 000:12:13.220
Thomas Woo: the coression whatever. Yeah, I think it will make a lot of mistake for this exercise, and working on sequel only would be much more easier for me to to to make a change whenever necessary.

109
000:12:13.270 --> 000:12:36.599
Thomas Woo: The second thing would be that II just wonder if II use the I'm not so sure but I use visualization tools like how. Vi. Whatever to look into the complication of the data to do some aggregation. I'm not so sure if it is. Get we've got a it's any performance

110
000:12:36.700 --> 000:12:46.399
Thomas Woo: impact that are local. Use a lot of time to extract the data. Yeah. So so this is my approach. Yeah.

111
000:12:46.480 --> 000:12:53.059
Thomas Woo: I'll show it's right on one. But I I'm a big fan of to get all those data in

112
000:12:53.120 --> 000:13:04.140
Thomas Woo: in advance. Put our table of view, whatever. Yeah. And and then just pick whatever cherry pick. What if I want from from those views? Yeah, this is

113
000:13:04.640 --> 000:13:21.749
Thomas Woo: what I am going to do. But I think lots of time. II still figure out all those sequel query and still not yet get to the end of the result. But yeah, I am. I think II my approach would be more strategically

114
000:13:21.850 --> 000:13:27.939
Thomas Woo: and also more in terms of modularity would be easier for me. Yeah, okay.

115
000:13:29.030 --> 000:13:31.110
Eben Uys: okay. thanks.

116
000:13:32.180 --> 000:13:35.430
Eben Uys:  So? Yeah, Florine.

117
000:13:35.530 --> 000:13:43.339
Florine: Yeah. Sorry. Just one last thing. Yeah. I just wasn't sure whether I could get the weekday

118
000:13:43.500 --> 000:13:48.729
Florine: or weekend day in sequel itself, or if I had to get it from power Bi. So

119
000:13:49.110 --> 000:14:07.649
Thomas Woo: that's why I was gonna go into power bi, even though I brought up wants to make the visual in excel. But II wasn't sure how to extract weekday or weekend.

120
000:14:07.670 --> 000:14:20.399
Florine: Yeah, I asked jet Gbt. But then I tried to put it in, and it didn't didn't work. So yeah, not sure. But yeah, if if anyone does know how to do it and wants to let me know, that would be great.

121
000:14:21.400 --> 000:14:33.609
Eben Uys: Yes, that's that's a really really good shout, Lauren. It's I'll go. And yes, what Thomas has put there. There is a way. But there's there's actually a website.

122
000:14:34.440 --> 000:14:37.110
Eben Uys: And it's 1 one of Google's pages

123
000:14:37.200 --> 000:14:43.819
Eben Uys: where dates you can convert to a lot of things like quotes

124
000:14:43.980 --> 000:14:54.309
Eben Uys: off Year day of week week of the year. and they are functions within bigquery, that if you have a date field

125
000:14:54.750 --> 000:15:00.049
Eben Uys: you can easily act upon it to extract weekday or

126
000:15:00.060 --> 000:15:10.349
Eben Uys: whatever you want. But that is one of the little curve pools in this exercise is actually, if you're in SQL, how do you actually extract the right level

127
000:15:10.640 --> 000:15:21.190
Eben Uys: which in this case was either week, the day of the week, or it could be weekend weekday, depending on how you would not work to approach the question

128
000:15:21.620 --> 000:15:42.039
Eben Uys: I would say in, I don't know this. This functions off the top of my it. I always go and Google them, because Microsoft sequel server is different to big query as well, and I sometimes know the big query one. Sometimes I know the Microsoft Sequel Server one, and sometimes I get them mixed up.

129
000:15:42.260 --> 000:15:54.769
Eben Uys: But knowing that they are functions that help you to convert to the right level of aggregation is quite useful, and that's that's a really good shout. That that is one of the little curve pools in this one

130
000:15:56.120 --> 000:15:57.290
Eben Uys: you'll see just

131
000:15:57.470 --> 000:16:03.829
Eben Uys: up in the chat I've put a little, and I've put it on slack as well. So in terms of that conversion funnel. So

132
000:16:04.180 --> 000:16:05.880
Eben Uys: if we just talk about

133
000:16:06.550 --> 000:16:10.899
Eben Uys: tactically or practically what you could have done in this exercise.

134
000:16:11.390 --> 000:16:14.790
Eben Uys: So for that funnel at the top

135
000:16:15.170 --> 000:16:19.960
Eben Uys: start on number of sessions which you could get from the sessions table right?

136
000:16:20.820 --> 000:16:21.970
Eben Uys: And

137
000:16:22.370 --> 000:16:26.830
Eben Uys: there's a little quirk in the sessions table that you'll learn about later.

138
000:16:27.110 --> 000:16:32.510
Eben Uys:  but just to give you it's up. You'll see in my

139
000:16:32.640 --> 000:16:49.679
Eben Uys: when I give you the queries later. I do a unique count of session Id. However, there are sessions that can span multiple days. So the sessions table is actually unique on a date session id level and not just on the session. Id level.

140
000:16:49.990 --> 000:16:55.190
Eben Uys: It's one of those annoying things about Google analytics. If you start a session

141
000:16:55.710 --> 000:17:02.569
Eben Uys: quarter to 12 at night, and you continue browsing into the next day. Duplicated over birthdays. That's neither.

142
000:17:02.700 --> 000:17:03.620
Eben Uys: But

143
000:17:03.910 --> 000:17:07.890
something to consider during apply, and we'll cut back to that.

144
000:17:08.569 --> 000:17:20.120
Eben Uys: and then at the bottom of the funnel, you want. Everyone else made a purchase. I sort of say to you, use the funnel events table. So if you think about that schematic that I've put there

145
000:17:20.250 --> 000:17:21.500
Eben Uys: stations.

146
000:17:21.800 --> 000:17:25.510
Eben Uys: who has viewed the product? Who's added the product to

147
000:17:25.530 --> 000:17:33.600
Eben Uys: cart and who is checked out. Always made a purchase right? So you could potentially count

148
000:17:34.110 --> 000:17:43.829
Eben Uys: the number of sessions that have late to a purchase where you didn't filter on purchase, and you'll see when I give you the 2 queries. The way that I've written. It is like

149
000:17:43.930 --> 000:17:47.249
Eben Uys: a select statement with a group by on the sessions table.

150
000:17:47.940 --> 000:18:17.879
Eben Uys: I take that result to excel. Then I do the same on the final events table. I take that to excel, and then I've used an excel. To divide the one by the other. One gives me number of visits, the other one gives me number of purchases, and that's how I calculate conversion right. There is a way to do it in one step with the join as well between the 2 tables. But then you do need to make sure that you don't not creating duplicates for the reason that I've just set because of its session. Id. I'll give you that query as well for you to to sort of

151
000:18:17.910 --> 000:18:20.060
Eben Uys: Hughes. Okay?

152
000:18:20.750 --> 000:18:27.930
Eben Uys: So I know not a lot of you got to the actual slide making side of things. But

153
000:18:29.610 --> 000:18:35.919
Eben Uys: what do you think about the request. What? What is? Sort of? Again? How would you actually.

154
000:18:38.290 --> 000:18:42.090
Eben Uys: if if you just have to think about creating a slide for this?

155
000:18:42.810 --> 000:18:54.259
Eben Uys: Let's say you got the data, and you have the data conversion rate by weekday for 2021. What would you put on this slide? What do you think of good things, do sort of

156
000:18:54.520 --> 000:18:58.279
Eben Uys: give and put on a slide for someone to take into a meeting

157
000:18:59.790 --> 000:19:07.659
Eben Uys: again. Let's let's steer away from. We only had an hour. I know that's very little time, but let's say

158
000:19:08.070 --> 000:19:15.150
Eben Uys: you could get to something reasonable within 2 or 3 h. What would you like to have on that slide.

159
000:19:15.330 --> 000:19:16.319
do you think

160
000:19:21.470 --> 000:19:22.520
Eben Uys: is Alex?

161
000:19:24.410 --> 000:19:34.610
Alex Kononov: If I may set my place so for Jc, he's obviously stronger than me in this department, so I would clearly hear he's opinion before doing mine.

162
000:19:35.120 --> 000:19:37.900
Eben Uys: Okay, jc, you're up.

163
000:19:38.800 --> 000:19:40.130
GC Storino: Okay. I was.

164
000:19:42.200 --> 000:19:43.470
thank you, Alex.

165
000:19:43.710 --> 000:19:52.809
GC Storino: Probably a a clustered bar shot, divided by the individual days. But the days are weekdays are colored differently to the ones that are weekends.

166
000:19:53.230 --> 000:19:53.890
Okay.

167
000:19:54.850 --> 000:19:59.209
GC Storino: sort of I guess, like a a red and blueish, not red and blue,

168
000:20:00.620 --> 000:20:03.849
GC Storino: red and or blue and orange, blue and orange. I work better

169
000:20:03.960 --> 000:20:05.180
GC Storino: because of the contrast.

170
000:20:06.340 --> 000:20:13.689
Eben Uys: Jason. Nice use of color to sort of say, Okay, this is my numbers for weekdays. This is my number for weekends.

171
000:20:14.030 --> 000:20:16.900
Eben Uys: Alex, do you have anything to add to that

172
000:20:17.310 --> 000:20:26.009
Alex Kononov: yes, I think. If we step back a bit from the tower part

173
000:20:26.310 --> 000:20:32.009
Alex Kononov: what's I would like to put on my slides. Obviously.

174
000:20:32.380 --> 000:20:45.229
Alex Kononov: things that I didn't do would be basically 3 small charts or more like 3 informations. One would be

175
000:20:45.600 --> 000:20:50.810
Alex Kononov: the timeline by day of the conversion rate.

176
000:20:50.870 --> 000:21:10.489
Alex Kononov: like Monday, etc. Monday, Tuesday with a line graph the second one would be a division 2 bar charts, or maybe a buy chart. Sorry for those who hate it. The division between the weekdays and weekends

177
000:21:11.180 --> 000:21:17.020
Alex Kononov: and maybe the

178
000:21:17.550 --> 000:21:20.630
Alex Kononov:  the timeline.

179
000:21:20.640 --> 000:21:23.489
Alex Kononov: I would add a

180
000:21:24.220 --> 000:21:29.670
Alex Kononov:  daily average daily minimum daily maximum.

181
000:21:30.880 --> 000:21:34.379
Eben Uys: Yeah, I think those are all really good suggestions

182
000:21:34.760 --> 000:21:37.500
Eben Uys: set. I think the thing that I would

183
000:21:37.980 --> 000:21:52.920
Eben Uys: ask you to think about, and I'm still. I'll give you the 2 queries or the queries that I've used. Please. If you have an hour, don't spend all day tomorrow. You have other stuff to do tomorrow, but if you have like an hour tomorrow.

184
000:21:53.370 --> 000:21:54.700
Eben Uys: take the data

185
000:21:54.730 --> 000:22:04.880
Eben Uys: from the queries and think about how you would position if you had to create a one Slider. Now, things I would ask you to think about is.

186
000:22:07.910 --> 000:22:13.580
Eben Uys: you could potentially. let's say, for example, the outcome is that, yeah.

187
000:22:13.690 --> 000:22:17.690
Eben Uys: week weekends is lower conversion than weekdays.

188
000:22:18.990 --> 000:22:25.000
Eben Uys: You could potentially anticipate what the stakeholder is. Gonna ask, right? They're probably gonna ask why?

189
000:22:26.100 --> 000:22:28.429
Eben Uys: So that's the one thing is.

190
000:22:29.650 --> 000:22:39.929
Eben Uys: is it that we're just getting, not not the same number of visits. And I'm just throwing out examples. This is for you to think about. I'm not giving you exactly how you should do it.

191
000:22:40.000 --> 000:22:50.559
Eben Uys: But typically a stakeholder will ask why, they will either ask why? Or they will ask, is it increasing or decreasing? So you could potentially compare against 2020 data to see

192
000:22:50.750 --> 000:22:56.920
Eben Uys: is weekends carrying increasing. Is it decreasing. or they would ask

193
000:22:57.150 --> 000:23:03.330
Eben Uys: if within that category of weekends versus weekdays it's lower. They will ask why.

194
000:23:03.640 --> 000:23:05.260
Eben Uys: what influences

195
000:23:05.820 --> 000:23:09.750
Eben Uys: conversion? Right. And we saw in the the diagram

196
000:23:10.050 --> 000:23:17.139
Eben Uys: visits and the Internet funnel. So visits could potentially, are we not getting the same number of visits over a weekend.

197
000:23:17.210 --> 000:23:18.840
Eben Uys: Then on a weekday.

198
000:23:19.440 --> 000:23:25.790
Eben Uys: if you had more time, and it was really a deep dive into this topic, you could go further. Right, and you could say

199
000:23:25.940 --> 000:23:28.850
Eben Uys: is the same people browsing during the week.

200
000:23:29.070 --> 000:23:33.360
Eben Uys: or they're browsing over weekend, but they're actually checking out

201
000:23:34.020 --> 000:23:37.429
Eben Uys: and purchasing during the week. That's something.

202
000:23:37.930 --> 000:23:38.660
Eben Uys: But

203
000:23:39.000 --> 000:23:48.160
Eben Uys: remember, we sort of saying to you as to have impact as a data analyst, it's not about just providing data. It's about providing context.

204
000:23:48.250 --> 000:23:53.770
Eben Uys: And it's anticipating what next? Questions could be asked by your stakeholders.

205
000:23:53.950 --> 000:23:59.029
Eben Uys: The one thing that I would say in this exercise, which is fun to think about is.

206
000:24:00.510 --> 000:24:01.940
Eben Uys: let's say

207
000:24:03.130 --> 000:24:06.689
Eben Uys: the weekend comes to a conversion rate of

208
000:24:07.360 --> 000:24:09.500
Eben Uys: 0 point 6%,

209
000:24:10.290 --> 000:24:16.639
Eben Uys: and the weekdays are coming to a conversion rate of 0 point 6 1.

210
000:24:17.310 --> 000:24:19.069
Eben Uys: What would you tell your stakeholder?

211
000:24:27.880 --> 000:24:29.029
Eben Uys: Yes, Alex.

212
000:24:31.160 --> 000:24:37.680
Alex Kononov: First of all, I would like to see the amounts of sales

213
000:24:38.180 --> 000:24:44.330
Alex Kononov: that corresponds to that conversion, and upon the difference of amount. If there is any.

214
000:24:44.400 --> 000:24:57.910
Alex Kononov: I would indicate that there is a difference between the weekday and weekend, but this difference is insignificant, and is equal to this amount of money on average.

215
000:24:58.320 --> 000:25:02.579
Eben Uys: Hmm, that's quite nice quantifying what it actually means.

216
000:25:03.150 --> 000:25:05.920
Eben Uys: Anyone have anything else I'd like to add.

217
000:25:08.150 --> 000:25:09.179
Eben Uys: yeah, Blynn.

218
000:25:11.670 --> 000:25:21.309
blens: I don't know. This is just. I guess it may not be the right answer. But do we think of how their correlator, like correlation, positive and negative?

219
000:25:21.520 --> 000:25:22.580
blens: Maybe

220
000:25:23.680 --> 000:25:29.029
blens: the people who are like visiting the website on weekends. If they're if it's related to

221
000:25:29.580 --> 000:25:33.980
blens: the purchase, something like that. Yeah. like, what time is going there.

222
000:25:34.550 --> 000:25:42.549
Eben Uys: You want to go a bit deeper, let let's say, for argument's sake, just it's 0 point 6 one and 0 point 6

223
000:25:43.690 --> 000:25:55.689
Eben Uys: If we go with that I think there are 2 things that you can sort of have in the back of your mind. And I typically refer to them either as statistically significant or practically significant.

224
000:25:55.850 --> 000:25:58.769
Eben Uys:  what Alex has mentioned

225
000:25:58.890 --> 000:26:19.840
Eben Uys: by quantifying what that difference actually means in terms of real revenue, real sales could potentially be a way of saying this is practically a practical, significant thing that we should do or that we should investigate. Right. Let's say, for example, we we see using Alex's calculation

226
000:26:20.460 --> 000:26:24.960
Eben Uys: that the revenue opportunity is something like 20,000 pounds.

227
000:26:27.480 --> 000:26:34.279
Eben Uys: Immediately. You can then say we have all these other things that could potentially be making us hundreds of thousands of pounds.

228
000:26:34.680 --> 000:26:46.990
Eben Uys: probably not as opportunity that we should look into now, or it could be in a place where you're on your business, where that's actually your next big opportunity. So that's that's a way of quantifying it. Practically significant.

229
000:26:47.380 --> 000:26:51.189
Eben Uys: Statistical significance comes down to hypothesis testing right?

230
000:26:51.320 --> 000:26:54.360
Eben Uys: So you can potentially test whether those 2

231
000:26:54.460 --> 000:26:58.210
Eben Uys: populations or sample populations are different.

232
000:26:58.850 --> 000:27:15.649
Eben Uys: using hypothesis testing  sometimes you might get a result that's not statistically significant. But if you actually quantify it back to revenue. Like, Alexis said.

233
000:27:15.720 --> 000:27:18.120
Eben Uys: it becomes quite a big opportunity.

234
000:27:18.340 --> 000:27:21.919
Eben Uys: If you think about what we're testing here

235
000:27:22.160 --> 000:27:27.520
Eben Uys: stations. The in going into that hypothesis state is quite large.

236
000:27:27.660 --> 000:27:35.520
Eben Uys: So even small differences might say, Oh, I'm statistically significant. However, if you're actually going, quantify.

237
000:27:36.050 --> 000:27:46.569
Eben Uys: or my small differences it might not. But if you actually can't quantify, it might be, or vice versa. So those are things to think about.

238
000:27:47.240 --> 000:27:59.550
Eben Uys: But in terms of next tips, what I want us to do is I'll post my queries again. If you have some time tomorrow, go and think about a slide, have a go at a slide.

239
000:27:59.660 --> 000:28:15.289
Eben Uys:  I would actually like to see if I have an opportunity later in the week, where we can have another of an hour, and we discuss some of the slides. What's good of what's bad? What could be better? In terms of what is being given to me?

240
000:28:15.790 --> 000:28:25.469
Eben Uys: So that that's sort of the next step. Any any questions, any comments on this one, anything that you feel we haven't discussed that we potentially should be discussing

241
000:28:31.440 --> 000:28:36.080
Eben Uys: also have a go at the exercise again without a time pressure. It does help

242
