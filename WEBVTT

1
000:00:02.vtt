1
000:00:02.740 --> 000:00:03.560
Steph Wright: There we go.

2
000:00:04.290 --> 000:00:07.549
Steph Wright: Keep those all got lots of slides here.

3
000:00:09.070 --> 000:00:11.180
Steph Wright: I mean, it's clean.

4
000:00:11.490 --> 000:00:13.399
Steph Wright: It's very, very clean.

5
000:00:13.670 --> 000:00:22.299
Steph Wright: I do wish the graphs would actually look like that. I mean, that sort of revenue growth would be beautiful. So is this your wireframe

6
000:00:22.490 --> 000:00:23.580
Steph Wright: orange team?

7
000:00:24.250 --> 000:00:33.590
Hamna Amer: Yeah. So it was just like the draft I made without any values or any data yet. So just I was assuming what it would come out as

8
000:00:35.150 --> 000:00:41.739
Steph Wright: II love the the assumed 30% increase in profit if we could do that every year. Yes.

9
000:00:41.890 --> 000:00:44.259
Steph Wright: like prism is going to go far.

10
000:00:45.250 --> 000:00:48.669
Steph Wright: But this is this is really clear that that headline

11
000:00:48.890 --> 000:00:55.300
Steph Wright: that we're talking about. We've got the increased part. and if you've dug in

12
000:00:55.840 --> 000:01:00.429
Steph Wright: to the the profit things and maybe split out by category.

13
000:01:00.710 --> 000:01:03.850
Steph Wright: you might see. were socks

14
000:01:03.870 --> 000:01:09.440
Steph Wright: responsible for this increase in profit as they were. Tell us.

15
000:01:09.960 --> 000:01:15.100
Steph Wright: I don't think there's any cycling stuff in the prism database, by the way, just so, you know.

16
000:01:16.290 --> 000:01:23.179
Steph Wright: But if it's if you're planning on having your site this clean. this is this is a really good place to start

17
000:01:23.510 --> 000:01:24.670
Steph Wright: speaking from

18
000:01:25.130 --> 000:01:29.440
Steph Wright: it requires very good speaker notes.

19
000:01:29.650 --> 000:01:34.030
Steph Wright: If you're not the person presenting. because

20
000:01:34.290 --> 000:01:39.880
Steph Wright: less Q on the slide means there's more chance that you forget what you're supposed to say.

21
000:01:41.020 --> 000:01:41.690
Just

22
000:01:41.930 --> 000:01:44.600
Steph Wright: I've been there. Your brain just goes.

23
000:01:45.630 --> 000:01:48.259
Steph Wright: Nope. Nope, don't remember this one.

24
000:01:48.430 --> 000:01:52.079
Steph Wright: but the great thing is, if you've picked the right visualisation

25
000:01:52.380 --> 000:01:53.540
Steph Wright: in order

26
000:01:53.640 --> 000:01:56.360
Steph Wright: to illustrate your headline.

27
000:01:56.910 --> 000:01:59.139
Steph Wright: then you can work it out as you go along.

28
000:01:59.490 --> 000:02:03.069
Steph Wright: Your audience can be working it out for themselves.

29
000:02:04.160 --> 000:02:09.980
Steph Wright: and it's just making sure that any of those points that you really want to land.

30
000:02:10.320 --> 000:02:14.110
Steph Wright: such as, okay, our profit increased because of socks.

31
000:02:15.350 --> 000:02:21.180
Steph Wright: Our recommendation is it that we're going to do something with socks because we think it's going to continue this way.

32
000:02:21.520 --> 000:02:23.999
Steph Wright: or do we think socks have had their time?

33
000:02:24.230 --> 000:02:27.509
Steph Wright: And it's time to try and spike profit

34
000:02:27.790 --> 000:02:28.980
Steph Wright: by looking at

35
000:02:29.170 --> 000:02:35.010
Steph Wright: X, because we've seen that there is something that we could potentially tap into.

36
000:02:36.050 --> 000:02:38.169
Steph Wright: And I can see on the next one. We

37
000:02:38.620 --> 000:02:43.639
Steph Wright: we've got stuff over time. and I'm a big fan, by the way.

38
000:02:43.740 --> 000:02:45.630
Steph Wright: of the slanted dates

39
000:02:45.640 --> 000:02:51.990
Steph Wright: versus having fewer dates horizontally. I think they're quite easy to read.

40
000:02:52.460 --> 000:02:53.190
Steph Wright: and

41
000:02:53.350 --> 000:03:02.240
Steph Wright: especially when you're doing a time shows you want to know the increments that your dots are in. This allows you to have more granular data.

42
000:03:03.420 --> 000:03:06.800
Steph Wright: Now, this is something I've I've been hoping would pop up.

43
000:03:07.240 --> 000:03:09.799
Steph Wright: You've defined your metric.

44
000:03:10.790 --> 000:03:12.540
Steph Wright: which I did ask you to do

45
000:03:13.870 --> 000:03:18.369
Steph Wright: to explain to your stakeholder how you're calculating this thing

46
000:03:18.400 --> 000:03:31.099
Steph Wright: so that we understand, like what it means because a lot of the time stakeholders will recognize conversion rate, they'll recognize Abbv. Say, but they've got no idea what that means.

47
000:03:31.760 --> 000:03:37.329
Steph Wright: And so stating it clearly, if that is the purpose of the presentation.

48
000:03:38.170 --> 000:03:39.799
Steph Wright: I wouldn't say it's a bad show.

49
000:03:41.090 --> 000:03:46.079
Steph Wright: And I can see you've left space like with your transactions recommendation, right?

50
000:03:46.450 --> 000:03:55.000
Steph Wright: Basically, we just summarise the big thing. Stick it in that top bit. I do like the colour scheme.

51
000:03:56.200 --> 000:04:06.499
Steph Wright: It's a consistent color scheme is is important. I'm going to put that out. For the most part it does not matter what your color scheme is, except

52
000:04:06.880 --> 000:04:10.359
Steph Wright: there are certain colours that people cannot tell apart.

53
000:04:10.890 --> 000:04:14.149
Steph Wright: I think one member of our staff is colorblind.

54
000:04:14.890 --> 000:04:26.120
Steph Wright: So if you're using red and green as color separators. You might want to rethink that. And you can find like, add ins for Google, that will assess the

55
000:04:26.290 --> 000:04:33.169
Steph Wright: is called an accessibility screen. So they'll look at the accessibility of your chosen colors

56
000:04:33.550 --> 000:04:35.979
Steph Wright: for anybody that's using them.

57
000:04:36.550 --> 000:04:41.840
Steph Wright: And even if you don't care about color, blind people being able to look at your stuff.

58
000:04:42.060 --> 000:04:59.820
Steph Wright: It does actually help. You see whether your colours are distracting as well. It gets you to really start thinking about the visual impact. Just like, remember Eddie Azard with the the big makeup around the eyes. Right? Little bit of colour choice makes a big impact.

59
000:05:01.560 --> 000:05:03.949
Steph Wright: We want to try and work with that

60
000:05:05.220 --> 000:05:06.320
Steph Wright: one thing. Nice.

61
000:05:07.420 --> 000:05:11.680
Steph Wright: All capitals when it's not an acronym.

62
000:05:12.050 --> 000:05:13.660
Steph Wright: Looks like you're shouting.

63
000:05:15.820 --> 000:05:18.569
Steph Wright: So it's also harder to read.

64
000:05:18.750 --> 000:05:24.000
Steph Wright: Not. It's going to stop people reading, but it will take them a fraction of a second longer

65
000:05:24.180 --> 000:05:31.149
Steph Wright: to read conversion rate in all caps than it will in lower case, I'm not bullshitting you. Studies have been done.

66
000:05:31.740 --> 000:05:42.309
Steph Wright: and so, unless it really is like you're trying to convince people that prism is about to die a slow, painful death because of something you've found. I would probably

67
000:05:42.630 --> 000:05:43.580
Steph Wright: avoid that

68
000:05:43.930 --> 000:05:47.670
Steph Wright: also. It then makes when you are using an acronym.

69
000:05:47.950 --> 000:05:49.129
Steph Wright: stand out more.

70
000:05:49.200 --> 000:05:52.069
Steph Wright: because it will be the only collection of

71
000:05:52.400 --> 000:05:55.429
Steph Wright: what's its capital letters on the screen.

72
000:05:56.540 --> 000:06:05.549
Steph Wright: I'm really hoping, Orange, if you've got questions with what I'm saying, you'll jump in if anybody's got thoughts like, please put your hand up, tap in.

73
000:06:05.630 --> 000:06:07.000
Steph Wright: Otherwise they

74
000:06:07.080 --> 000:06:18.510
Muhammad Sabbagh: gave lots of slides, so I'm trying to make sure I can go through all of them right? So structure we were thinking of doing was to go with the Wi-frame initially, which shows off the

75
000:06:18.580 --> 000:06:24.429
Muhammad Sabbagh: and all the key guys. We were told we had to include all 8, at least within the presentation, just as a show off

76
000:06:24.520 --> 000:06:45.990
Muhammad Sabbagh: and then, after that point was to focus on on the 3 main kpis that we thought was the most significant. So for the structure, would you say to start with, you know, just an introduction with the wireframe essentially, and then 3 slides for each kpi that we think is the most significant. And then the conclusion, or am I thinking this incorrectly

77
000:06:46.700 --> 000:06:55.330
Steph Wright: so what we're trying to do is sell the idea of this dashboard to our stakeholders. So we're trying to show them that it's useful.

78
000:06:55.960 --> 000:07:04.609
Steph Wright: which means we should probably start with showing them what we intend for it to look like. So here is how I'm going to display these Kpis for you. Isn't it clear

79
000:07:05.100 --> 000:07:13.580
Steph Wright: these are the things that we're gonna work on? You maybe touch quickly on definitions of the ones that you aren't gonna dig into.

80
000:07:14.330 --> 000:07:15.869
Muhammad Sabbagh: Right? Yeah. Good

81
000:07:16.020 --> 000:07:22.009
Steph Wright: dig into the ones that you are planning on explaining with a recommendation. It's wasting time.

82
000:07:22.050 --> 000:07:25.399
Steph Wright: People don't like hearing that sort of thing just repeated.

83
000:07:26.280 --> 000:07:28.310
Muhammad Sabbagh: Yeah, so you leave out your 3.

84
000:07:28.930 --> 000:07:32.750
Steph Wright: Then yeah, move on to the individual ones.

85
000:07:32.860 --> 000:07:34.819
Steph Wright: Look at yeah, the Kpi itself.

86
000:07:34.930 --> 000:07:39.720
Steph Wright: what it's telling you. And therefore what you plan to do

87
000:07:39.820 --> 000:07:42.149
Steph Wright: based on this shiny new knowledge

88
000:07:43.660 --> 000:07:50.550
Steph Wright: plan to do is really easy to find, usually from splitting out your data

89
000:07:50.700 --> 000:07:54.659
Steph Wright: in different ways. We go and do a lot of that next week.

90
000:07:54.970 --> 000:08:00.080
Steph Wright: so you'll you'll get much practice. But this is where those kind of

91
000:08:00.790 --> 000:08:06.880
Steph Wright: you can either set your own groupings with a case. Select statement or you can go. Well, we've got categories.

92
000:08:07.040 --> 000:08:13.110
Steph Wright: We've got sizes. There's various things that you could split your Kpis out

93
000:08:13.330 --> 000:08:17.119
Steph Wright: for the investigation portion of what you're doing.

94
000:08:18.760 --> 000:08:19.690
Muhammad Sabbagh: Thanks.

95
000:08:20.460 --> 000:08:21.360
Okay.

96
000:08:21.760 --> 000:08:24.890
Steph Wright: Oh, we got some pink. However.

97
000:08:26.980 --> 000:08:27.780
Steph Wright: I

98
000:08:28.170 --> 000:08:50.600
Steph Wright: I'm not sure if you can overcome this in power. Bi, I think you can. I really really hate the underscores between the the things of the column headers that bigquery forces you to have because it doesn't like 2 words when you're doing a legend, you, if something is repeated in every single one of your

99
000:08:50.880 --> 000:08:51.880
groups.

100
000:08:52.100 --> 000:08:53.630
Steph Wright: take it out so I would

101
000:08:53.920 --> 000:08:55.240
Steph Wright: just delete

102
000:08:55.360 --> 000:08:57.769
Steph Wright: the underscore Ctr.

103
000:08:57.850 --> 000:09:04.080
Steph Wright: For all of this, because we know that this is a graph of pick through right? Because you've told me

104
000:09:04.190 --> 000:09:05.340
Steph Wright: in the headline.

105
000:09:06.490 --> 000:09:08.929
Steph Wright: So then, it's just Google, Meta

106
000:09:09.010 --> 000:09:10.280
Steph Wright: and the other ones.

107
000:09:12.410 --> 000:09:14.090
Steph Wright: We've got the

108
000:09:14.310 --> 000:09:21.610
Steph Wright: the click-through rates here. Now we've got 3 highlighted. I'm assuming that they're the ones that you're going to talk through.

109
000:09:22.570 --> 000:09:25.340
Steph Wright: My my question is

110
000:09:26.010 --> 000:09:30.370
Steph Wright: the order of them I'm trying to work out.

111
000:09:31.180 --> 000:09:47.909
Steph Wright: Is it that you're sort of saying like, what's the the logic behind starting with the smaller number and going to the bigger rather than flip program. It's just because counterintuitive to look at. There could be a perfectly reasonable explanation. It's just late in the afternoon for me.

112
000:09:48.910 --> 000:09:56.560
Hamna Amer: Well, II didn't pay attention to the order in while making this, so we're just like a random order. Then I because.

113
000:09:56.610 --> 000:09:57.790
Hamna Amer: Oh, okay.

114
000:09:58.030 --> 000:10:01.680
Steph Wright: I just if if there was a reason.

115
000:10:01.690 --> 000:10:05.830
Steph Wright: But that is something to bear in mind. Do you remember way back when

116
000:10:05.960 --> 000:10:15.919
Steph Wright: in a choir. We said that you've got to be careful with using line charts because they imply an order of something, even if there isn't an order to it.

117
000:10:16.200 --> 000:10:24.609
Steph Wright: Same with when we stack things vertically, we automatically assume that you are trying to show us an ordered list.

118
000:10:24.690 --> 000:10:28.289
Steph Wright: Now, it just so happens that the numbers have worked out that way

119
000:10:28.550 --> 000:10:29.540
Steph Wright: for you.

120
000:10:30.340 --> 000:10:34.699
Steph Wright: If it was Google first, I probably wouldn't have clocked it.

121
000:10:34.750 --> 000:10:43.369
Steph Wright: But what I would do is, I would match all of the colors. The Rtb house. One is a different color

122
000:10:43.410 --> 000:10:45.380
Steph Wright: than it is in your graph.

123
000:10:45.660 --> 000:10:49.899
Steph Wright: and it's a little bit too close to the the overall CTR. One.

124
000:10:50.360 --> 000:10:53.130
Steph Wright: For me. I love colour. Can you tell

125
000:10:53.950 --> 000:10:55.809
Steph Wright: it? It can be

126
000:10:55.930 --> 000:10:58.420
Steph Wright: really transformative

127
000:10:58.540 --> 000:11:04.429
Steph Wright: in terms of people's understanding, but it can also be incredibly distracting.

128
000:11:05.200 --> 000:11:08.049
Steph Wright: And so it's thinking, what do we need to show?

129
000:11:08.220 --> 000:11:12.430
Steph Wright: And I'm going to ask a question here. Tiktok and

130
000:11:13.150 --> 000:11:15.619
Steph Wright: Critio, whatever the hell that is.

131
000:11:15.860 --> 000:11:19.159
Steph Wright: we've got one data point for them.

132
000:11:19.530 --> 000:11:23.790
Steph Wright: Are you planning on talking about those 2

133
000:11:24.030 --> 000:11:26.469
Steph Wright: with regards to click through rate?

134
000:11:27.930 --> 000:11:47.689
Muhammad Sabbagh: There is some stuff we can mention, like the fact that it's an up and coming web source. So it's important that we, seeing as we lack the information we're showing that it's lacking. And so it's valuable for us to invest more into finding out whether or not it could generate CTO. So that's why it's important to have there, in my opinion, is that your recommendation?

135
000:11:47.870 --> 000:11:53.009
Muhammad Sabbagh: I would recommend, yeah, that we we look in. Do you invest more into finding out what it shows.

136
000:11:53.320 --> 000:11:56.819
Steph Wright: As long as that's your recommendation. then they should stay.

137
000:11:57.910 --> 000:12:05.410
Steph Wright: But if they didn't come into your recommendation at all, because they're not referenced over here with the the other click through rates.

138
000:12:05.850 --> 000:12:08.089
Steph Wright: you could say to yourself.

139
000:12:08.130 --> 000:12:14.979
Steph Wright: Well, there's an awful lot of visual real estate being taken up by the legend for Crito and Tiktok.

140
000:12:15.130 --> 000:12:20.990
Steph Wright: You might want to take them out, and then very explicitly state

141
000:12:21.200 --> 000:12:31.920
Steph Wright: that you have taken them out, because you're looking at the trend over time rather than specifically at those 2. Now, that's not what you're doing, so don't take them out.

142
000:12:31.980 --> 000:12:40.080
Steph Wright: I'm just saying, at the opposite end of the scale, you might end up taking a different choice. Marcello, please weigh in.

143
000:12:40.470 --> 000:12:54.509
Marcelo Lecocq: No, no, no, I think you're right, so that if you put them there and you put the headline. Oh, we should invest in Tiktok. It's like you lost me. They don't. We don't even have data for, remember who you presented to

144
000:12:54.610 --> 000:13:09.700
Marcelo Lecocq: presenting to people in prison or executives that got ideas of 3 vendors here, Google, Meta and Rtb, okay, they. They experimented, perhaps, with the other Tiktok Andreto and you.

145
000:13:09.760 --> 000:13:13.889
Marcelo Lecocq: You may have information about the market and the trends around Tiktok.

146
000:13:14.220 --> 000:13:19.790
Marcelo Lecocq: If you do have them put them in there and suggest we need to invest more in tick, Tock.

147
000:13:19.810 --> 000:13:22.129
Marcelo Lecocq: But don't suggest something. You cannot back up

148
000:13:22.760 --> 000:13:35.509
Marcelo Lecocq: because you'll dig yourself deep into a conversation. You cannot get out, you know. An executive could ask you why, why, tik Tok? I know nothing about Tik Tok, and you, unless you know and you've got data about tick tock.

149
000:13:36.080 --> 000:13:37.130
Marcelo Lecocq: Don't put it there.

150
000:13:37.180 --> 000:14:01.560
Marcelo Lecocq: That will be my advice. Focus on what you've got. What people understand. Okay, if you're working with the marketing team, of course. Hey, I've got this document. That shows that tick. Tock is the biggest platform growing in in a number of connections, etc., etc., etc. But if you don't have that. I will personally remove anything that is not familiar to the executives.

151
000:14:02.680 --> 000:14:04.860
Muhammad Sabbagh: That's that makes sense. Thanks.

152
000:14:07.040 --> 000:14:16.210
Steph Wright: I love having other coaches in the room who can like weigh in. You're getting very targeted. Slight feedback. I hope this is helpful.

153
000:14:16.550 --> 000:14:18.880
Muhammad Sabbagh: Yeah, that's why I wanted to record it. Yeah.

154
000:14:19.130 --> 000:14:22.829
Steph Wright: Yeah. But even if it's not your slides that we're looking at.

155
000:14:23.010 --> 000:14:24.899
Steph Wright: I hope that by going through them

156
000:14:25.290 --> 000:14:30.500
Steph Wright: you can take away something from that and then apply it

157
000:14:30.550 --> 000:14:31.580
Steph Wright: to yours.

158
000:14:32.720 --> 000:14:34.300
Steph Wright: Okay? So

159
000:14:36.550 --> 000:14:37.480
Steph Wright: soaks.

160
000:14:37.730 --> 000:14:53.520
Steph Wright: did someone go and put that in after our discussion, or was it already in there? Because if if it was Marcella, you're a Wizard. But but, by the way, is that I made it up. I didn't know the the prisons so socks. I haven't looked into the prison. We I'm pretty sure we sell socks.

161
000:14:53.570 --> 000:15:14.560
Steph Wright: I was looking at the presentations, and there was socks in it. So I just put socks as the title same wavelength. That's what this is.

162
000:15:15.010 --> 000:15:21.180
Steph Wright: You've found your person. See? Looking at this one.

163
000:15:22.970 --> 000:15:26.280
Steph Wright: I'm not sure what the story is

164
000:15:26.510 --> 000:15:29.030
Steph Wright: between the left hand graph

165
000:15:29.450 --> 000:15:34.010
Steph Wright: and the right hand. Graph. It's the first one where I haven't really known

166
000:15:34.350 --> 000:15:38.819
Steph Wright: what, how everything I've seen in these slides works together. Now

167
000:15:38.950 --> 000:15:44.909
Steph Wright: you can overcome that by tying it, together with your narrative.

168
000:15:45.980 --> 000:15:51.249
Steph Wright: but I would recommend that the titles that you're putting on those visualizations

169
000:15:51.440 --> 000:15:56.300
Steph Wright: give me some hint as to why they're both there.

170
000:15:57.820 --> 000:16:02.630
Steph Wright: I'm sure once we've got the different items in, it will become easier

171
000:16:02.990 --> 000:16:03.910
Steph Wright: to see.

172
000:16:04.480 --> 000:16:08.320
Steph Wright: But it's just at at the moment. I think the hypothetical

173
000:16:08.470 --> 000:16:17.999
Steph Wright: nature of this has made it a little bit unclear compared to the others. But if you follow the same kind of logic you've done previously.

174
000:16:20.690 --> 000:16:24.870
Marcelo Lecocq: I think you've got 2 stories here, whoever it's a hammer, you develop this slide.

175
000:16:25.410 --> 000:16:39.250
Marcelo Lecocq: Yeah. So I was assuming that so the pro, like the items, like the most profitable ones, and then look into the return rate of them like if they're being returned from this. First of all, the inside

176
000:16:39.300 --> 000:16:43.860
Marcelo Lecocq: is, I'm I'm super. I'm I'm assuming socks is your top number one. Item.

177
000:16:44.290 --> 000:16:54.629
Marcelo Lecocq: yeah, that's fine. If you think about, you know, what's the story you want to say is is the highest profit. Okay, out of 100% of your profit.

178
000:16:54.730 --> 000:16:57.320
Marcelo Lecocq: How much socks contribute towards

179
000:16:59.140 --> 000:17:08.550
Marcelo Lecocq: think about how how much socks contribute to your profit as a percentage of the total profit and see whether that's changing over time. Just 2 years or 3 years of data.

180
000:17:08.560 --> 000:17:28.429
Marcelo Lecocq: increasing profits. Contribution. That's one story, II think, is brilliant. Okay? So that perhaps oh, I didn't know we're selling so many sales. And I didn't know it was so so much profitable and and actually, the profitability is increasing as a percentage of ourselves. The second one that could be tied to someone else's slide.

181
000:17:28.620 --> 000:17:35.030
Marcelo Lecocq: He's about the 20, I think, is with Karun that has a 28% return percentage.

182
000:17:35.150 --> 000:17:41.880
Marcelo Lecocq: It could be that what is the contribution of the top 5 items.

183
000:17:42.200 --> 000:17:45.460
Marcelo Lecocq: profitable, profitable items towards that return rate.

184
000:17:45.820 --> 000:17:50.940
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay, actually, socks are contributing positively to the return rate because they go.

185
000:17:51.000 --> 000:18:01.569
Marcelo Lecocq: You know, one of the lowest one. Okay, so I think there's 2 really interesting stories you can develop out of this 2 slides, perhaps not enough time for tomorrow. But but I think you bang on the money.

186
000:18:01.910 --> 000:18:02.680
Hamna Amer: And

187
000:18:07.500 --> 000:18:22.490
Jack C: I yeah, I just didn't have. Is that like, is this like hypothetical? Because we, the data hasn't. We don't have like the codes informed yet. So I was just assuming and

188
000:18:22.500 --> 000:18:25.429
Hamna Amer: thinking how the presentation might look like.

189
000:18:25.740 --> 000:18:27.699
yeah, no, I think it's a really

190
000:18:28.480 --> 000:18:37.689
Jack C: smart way to do it, because I think that's like our team which are next, we're like, you kind of like in limbo of exactly like what we're gonna be doing.

191
000:18:37.890 --> 000:18:43.509
Jack C: Because it's not yet confirmed. So yeah, it's just. I think it was a good way to do it

192
000:18:44.100 --> 000:18:45.590
hypothetically

193
000:18:45.940 --> 000:18:49.880
Jack C: took the words right out of my mouth, and I don't know.

194
000:18:49.970 --> 000:18:53.289
Jack C: I think you might be the first person

195
000:18:53.580 --> 000:18:55.679
Jack C: in the history of this course

196
000:18:55.950 --> 000:18:59.079
Jack C: to have built a slide deck prior.

197
000:18:59.710 --> 000:19:10.170
Steph Wright: not even on the first project, but second, third, like we hammer this all the time. Wireframe a dashboard, but wireframe your slides

198
000:19:10.480 --> 000:19:13.389
Steph Wright: right. You just have to then slot it in

199
000:19:14.130 --> 000:19:15.900
Steph Wright: mush stuff around a bit.

200
000:19:15.960 --> 000:19:21.609
Steph Wright: This is the divide and conquer approach like it can often feel when you're given the presenting role.

201
000:19:21.700 --> 000:19:27.849
Steph Wright: for example. Oh, well, I'm going to be scrabbling around absolutely last minute to do it. No.

202
000:19:28.420 --> 000:19:30.890
Steph Wright: you know that you're going to have to have an introduction.

203
000:19:31.500 --> 000:19:35.170
Steph Wright: You're going to have to have a body, and you're going to have to have a summation.

204
000:19:35.280 --> 000:19:37.930
Steph Wright: Now the introduction you could be working on straight away.

205
000:19:38.160 --> 000:19:44.889
Steph Wright: The body is going to involve you talking to all of the different people that's doing it, finding out where

206
000:19:45.070 --> 000:19:46.060
Steph Wright: the

207
000:19:46.250 --> 000:19:48.590
Steph Wright: kind of investigations are going.

208
000:19:48.650 --> 000:19:50.629
Steph Wright: so that you can start thinking.

209
000:19:50.930 --> 000:19:55.610
Steph Wright: And by them explaining to you what they're working on things will become clearer to them

210
000:19:56.500 --> 000:19:59.979
Steph Wright: like wireframing is the best way to start

211
000:20:00.010 --> 000:20:01.560
Steph Wright: anything.

212
000:20:02.710 --> 000:20:05.620
Steph Wright: because it saves you time overall.

213
000:20:06.400 --> 000:20:10.129
Steph Wright: You will realize this very much next week.

214
000:20:11.990 --> 000:20:13.299
Learn from past mistakes.

215
000:20:13.760 --> 000:20:15.799
Steph Wright: Alright, I'm going to go into

216
000:20:16.240 --> 000:20:17.380
Steph Wright: this one.

217
000:20:18.320 --> 000:20:21.879
Steph Wright: I did. I like that arrow. I don't know if I should.

218
000:20:21.910 --> 000:20:28.239
Steph Wright: but I kind of like that right? Here's the bubble move to the next one. It it implies movement.

219
000:20:28.550 --> 000:20:32.930
Steph Wright: and if you had kind of like those numbers going up, you could almost offset them

220
000:20:33.530 --> 000:20:35.990
Steph Wright: slightly, the showing arrow going up

221
000:20:36.550 --> 000:20:42.150
Steph Wright: same as if it goes down like really hammer home. That behaviour change.

222
000:20:42.700 --> 000:20:54.380
Steph Wright: But II think you can see from this that you've you've got this idea of clarity being important. You just have to make sure that when you put in the real visualizations.

223
000:20:54.510 --> 000:20:58.620
Steph Wright: the real bits of text that you don't allow

224
000:20:58.670 --> 000:21:03.540
Steph Wright: this this clean set of slides to be overwhelmed

225
000:21:03.790 --> 000:21:12.559
Steph Wright: by people going by. And I need this much up. Well, then, it's going to have to be an extra slide. or it's too much stuff for one presentation. Pick your favourite.

226
000:21:12.650 --> 000:21:15.500
Steph Wright: because, as the people doing the slides.

227
000:21:15.570 --> 000:21:21.109
Steph Wright: you have the power largely to decide what goes into them. and if you don't think

228
000:21:21.220 --> 000:21:28.259
Steph Wright: that something meets the criteria of a data supported recommendation.

229
000:21:28.680 --> 000:21:31.020
Steph Wright: Should you be putting it in your slide deck.

230
000:21:34.040 --> 000:21:43.599
Steph Wright: Nope, you are the final line of defense. You and the presenter. You are the people that choose what the stakeholders see. If you know they shouldn't be seeing what you've put in

231
000:21:43.690 --> 000:21:44.740
Steph Wright: reconsider.

232
000:21:46.240 --> 000:21:49.850
Steph Wright: I probably won't be sensible like that again for the rest of the session. Just so, you know.

233
000:21:51.150 --> 000:21:56.899
Steph Wright: you'll be glad to know Okido ski. So, Jack, you were saying, this is

234
000:21:57.060 --> 000:21:58.440
Jack C: your group. Yes.

235
000:21:59.520 --> 000:22:06.359
Jack C: this is this is all great. There's actually quite a lot of us here. Just Paul Marsden is the only person in the data Review.

236
000:22:06.470 --> 000:22:09.980
Jack C: Oh, bless him! And he is not the biggest fan of sequel I remember.

237
000:22:10.060 --> 000:22:13.279
Jack C: Would you like this recorded, or would you like me to stop recording?

238
000:22:13.380 --> 000:22:21.679
Jack C: I did. Yeah, I didn't. Well, I can't speak for the others. But I've probably I've been writing notes as you go along, anyway, before we do the same.

239
000:22:22.340 --> 000:22:28.630
Jack C: I'll leave it running then. So is this a why, what is this? A wireframe of Tommy? Talk to me?

240
000:22:28.760 --> 000:22:39.560
Yeah. So we'd I just started roughly doing. It's not that long ago doing just the wireframe of what the dashboard could look like.

241
000:22:39.670 --> 000:22:49.940
and then and then had that we actually need a real dashboard to stop doing it and then start to make a dashboard. But I'm not going to do that. I'm just as far as I'm

242
000:22:50.300 --> 000:22:55.860
Jack C: from, like Google or dashboard wireframe is just what it's gonna look like, right?

243
000:22:56.910 --> 000:23:01.059
Jack C: Yeah. So this is like a very bad version, or

244
000:23:01.630 --> 000:23:07.829
Jack C: some of the ones I've drawn over the years. I really do my wireframes with a pad and pen.

245
000:23:08.100 --> 000:23:13.769
Jack C: I have. Yeah, I did a bit of that, but wanted to get it in.

246
000:23:13.840 --> 000:23:19.039
and so that will just be the wireframe at the start. Is that what you'd imagine the slides.

247
000:23:20.050 --> 000:23:23.869
Jack C: once it's done to look like, just to give them like an insight.

248
000:23:25.130 --> 000:23:26.000
Jack C: So

249
000:23:26.400 --> 000:23:42.629
Jack C: I would maybe finish flesh this out so that because you're showing it as something with some of these visualizations in like average return, right? We're gonna need an example, one fit for each of them. Otherwise it's going to look very strange, even if it is completely.

250
000:23:43.990 --> 000:23:45.530
Jack C: you know, made up.

251
000:23:45.790 --> 000:23:56.469
Jack C: Yeah, yeah. So just have. Like, I was just gonna have a section for each of the 8 Apis with like the headline and a visualization, and then show what how they would be able to filter.

252
000:23:59.380 --> 000:24:03.229
Jack C: I would maybe, instead of where you've got dates for. Oh.

253
000:24:03.360 --> 000:24:14.009
Jack C: I didn't realize you touched in it, so I would probably show here just the date filter part, not show the the breakdown. But say.

254
000:24:14.040 --> 000:24:31.230
Jack C: when you're walking them through that they if I was talking to a stakeholder, imagine, and I'm explaining this. And I think that my filter is really gonna help you out. It's gonna make your life easier. I'm like, so we've got our 8 kpis and the brilliant thing about the dashboard is that you can choose whether to have data from all time

255
000:24:31.350 --> 000:24:43.739
Jack C: filtered to the previous year, 6 months, 3 months, or, in fact, any custom range that your heart desires saving you, having to ask anybody in the analytics team to do this for you, making it quicker.

256
000:24:44.850 --> 000:24:51.099
Jack C: Do you see that? How I'm explaining the functionality of the dashboard. But I'm also telling them why the

257
000:24:51.180 --> 000:24:52.750
Jack C: I've built it for them.

258
000:24:53.120 --> 000:25:05.039
Jack C: because I haven't shown that information on the wireframe. It's we tease with the Wi-fi so that we can then sell the story

259
000:25:05.500 --> 000:25:07.970
Jack C: when we're going through it.

260
000:25:09.190 --> 000:25:12.060
Jack C: But yeah, in terms of having your your 8

261
000:25:12.220 --> 000:25:16.690
Jack C: kpis. It's just making sure that they look at that and go. I could use that.

262
000:25:18.240 --> 000:25:22.289
Jack C: But I'd have you build that. Take the time to build it. Thank you very much. Yes, please.

263
000:25:23.980 --> 000:25:28.149
Jack C: So onto the slides, which I can see we've got. So we've got

264
000:25:28.580 --> 000:25:29.550
Jack C: headline

265
000:25:30.110 --> 000:25:38.639
Jack C: return rate increases with X category. I love seeing how people haven't kind of gone through and added things as we're talking, because

266
000:25:38.710 --> 000:25:41.139
Jack C: we've only been on a call 64 min

267
000:25:41.310 --> 000:25:46.760
Jack C: right, and you've already found ways to improve your slides right?

268
000:25:46.940 --> 000:25:48.480
Steph Wright: It's that easy.

269
000:25:48.780 --> 000:25:55.760
Steph Wright: We just talk about stuff. And this is why I want you to share your wireframes next week with each other

270
000:25:55.830 --> 000:26:05.589
Steph Wright: without us having to tell you to. I want you to go to people in other teams and like, could you take a look at my slide deck and let me know what you think like. Have us stuck to the rules.

271
000:26:05.850 --> 000:26:08.040
Steph Wright: and if you all do that for each other

272
000:26:08.680 --> 000:26:09.690
Steph Wright: lovely.

273
000:26:09.940 --> 000:26:11.770
Steph Wright: Now, someone

274
000:26:12.350 --> 000:26:27.249
Steph Wright: I don't know who who put this in the the little size something. I don't know if this is there to flatten me, or if you just like, the fact that I tend to do this on my slides. But sometimes, having a subheader

275
000:26:27.410 --> 000:26:28.540
Jack C: is useful

276
000:26:29.160 --> 000:26:33.019
Jack C: in what you're doing, where you're explaining what these Kpis are.

277
000:26:33.420 --> 000:26:44.789
Jack C: That is a very good way to get that information in there, concisely, and in a small bit. But you gotta make sure that whatever you put in that subtitle

278
000:26:44.910 --> 000:26:48.599
Jack C: is visually much shorter

279
000:26:49.050 --> 000:26:53.180
Jack C: than what is in your headline, because your headline is more important.

280
000:26:53.410 --> 000:27:01.349
Jack C: and if you have your text running out after it. People will ignore the headline, and they'll look down at the thing that they think has more detail

281
000:27:01.840 --> 000:27:07.389
Jack C: in so subtiters can be useful or sub headings, they can

282
000:27:07.960 --> 000:27:09.160
Jack C: cause a problem.

283
000:27:09.260 --> 000:27:12.089
Jack C: You've just got to think about them as you're going

284
000:27:12.440 --> 000:27:25.770
Jack C: nice. Yeah, I'll look. I know it was just that it was something that you like in how many slides to define it. So put it there as a note, and then also to add X-axis diagonal labels to grind.

285
000:27:26.390 --> 000:27:28.480
Jack C: And I think

286
000:27:29.090 --> 000:27:31.909
Jack C: this this might be the first really clear

287
000:27:32.120 --> 000:27:35.369
Jack C: one that is trying to follow the pyramid principle.

288
000:27:36.190 --> 000:27:38.709
Jack C: Tell me the most important thing. First

289
000:27:38.980 --> 000:27:42.900
Jack C: recommendation. Then you're showing me.

290
000:27:43.020 --> 000:27:44.819
Jack C: This is why I think that.

291
000:27:45.530 --> 000:27:48.079
Jack C: Do we remember doing the Pyramid principle? Anyone

292
000:27:49.830 --> 000:28:01.450
Jack C: start with the most important thing when you've got the people's attention. So headline recommendation. Now, if I'm still got your attention, I'll take you through. Why, I think that

293
000:28:02.460 --> 000:28:06.660
Jack C: be prepared in real life. You will lose some stakeholders

294
000:28:06.800 --> 000:28:15.299
Jack C: after the first first thing after the headline, because they will whip their phone out to check if they've got any emails because they are that high powered.

295
000:28:16.290 --> 000:28:19.400
Jack C: So we've really got to lean into this idea

296
000:28:19.420 --> 000:28:21.279
Jack C: of key takeaways

297
000:28:22.610 --> 000:28:23.830
Jack C: and

298
000:28:23.890 --> 000:28:34.470
Jack C: on the graph just quickly add a question made it like the return data is like that when I lost. Look, there isn't any return data

299
000:28:34.480 --> 000:28:36.750
Jack C: from like the 30 first of

300
000:28:36.920 --> 000:28:51.700
Jack C: December onwards. So it's like, if I feel like it's pulling down the December 2021, and there's 0 for January. Do you think I should just exclude them from the graph? Because it looks like return rate is like drastically drop in.

301
000:28:51.920 --> 000:28:55.180
Jack C: Yes, because of the stakeholders that you're presenting to.

302
000:28:55.290 --> 000:29:02.830
Jack C: because they are high-level stakeholders. You really don't want to have to waste their time explaining to them why you have a value of 0

303
000:29:03.190 --> 000:29:07.119
Jack C: when actually it's not, it's just not enough. Time has elapsed

304
000:29:07.140 --> 000:29:09.380
Jack C: for those things that were bought

305
000:29:09.390 --> 000:29:11.230
Jack C: to have been returned

306
000:29:11.400 --> 000:29:14.439
Jack C: and stuck into the dataset.

307
000:29:14.750 --> 000:29:19.419
Jack C: If you were presenting this to the head of data and analytics.

308
000:29:20.760 --> 000:29:22.680
Jack C: I might leave it in

309
000:29:22.860 --> 000:29:24.839
Jack C: and say what I just said.

310
000:29:24.980 --> 000:29:29.249
Jack C: but more concisely and better practised, because.

311
000:29:29.630 --> 000:29:34.740
Jack C: data person is more than happy to have something qualified, and they would

312
000:29:34.950 --> 000:29:37.399
Steph Wright: prefer that than having it left out.

313
000:29:38.340 --> 000:29:42.230
Steph Wright: whereas stake big stakeholders. Just show me what actually matters.

314
000:29:43.260 --> 000:29:46.589
Jack C: But, Jack, Jack, quick, quick question to you. Okay.

315
000:29:47.140 --> 000:29:52.040
Marcelo Lecocq: who do you think will be interested in an organization to saying

316
000:29:52.480 --> 000:29:57.580
Marcelo Lecocq: that chart, although the fact that after, let's say 2 months.

317
000:29:57.640 --> 000:30:00.480
Marcelo Lecocq: we still don't have data on this Kpi.

318
000:30:03.560 --> 000:30:04.710
he

319
000:30:06.930 --> 000:30:10.100
Jack C: who would be interested in the graph as a as it is at the moment.

320
000:30:10.200 --> 000:30:15.610
Marcelo Lecocq: Yeah. So you you telling me the reason why you don't 0 because you don't have data for those months.

321
000:30:16.290 --> 000:30:18.390
Jack C: And yeah, it's lapsed.

322
000:30:18.640 --> 000:30:28.380
Jack C: Right? So think about with the hand of the business guy. Say. is it? Okay, on the modern, on a digital company?

323
000:30:28.780 --> 000:30:33.930
Jack C: The I don't. I don't have returns data after 2 months of the event.

324
000:30:35.850 --> 000:30:39.969
Marcelo Lecocq: How digital am I? Okay? So that could be an historian itself.

325
000:30:40.680 --> 000:30:42.600
Yeah, like a data

326
000:30:42.670 --> 000:30:43.780
Jack C: architect

327
000:30:44.060 --> 000:30:54.240
Jack C: or something along the along those lines. Like, you know, you know, process is broken. Tagline is a data capture for returns process broken.

328
000:30:54.760 --> 000:30:59.170
Jack C: But yeah, okay, that's

329
000:31:00.820 --> 000:31:03.239
Jack C: from where you think

330
000:31:03.700 --> 000:31:05.300
Jack C: spending your time

331
000:31:05.380 --> 000:31:11.000
Jack C: is gonna improve things. If we're looking at actually tracking returns

332
000:31:11.280 --> 000:31:14.269
Jack C: the return rate, so that we can have

333
000:31:14.570 --> 000:31:20.569
Steph Wright: like tactics to deal with it. If something does drop or go up dramatically.

334
000:31:20.950 --> 000:31:21.730
Steph Wright: then

335
000:31:22.030 --> 000:31:28.519
Steph Wright: what Marcelo has brought up that lack of data becomes the most pressing thing that would stop us

336
000:31:28.530 --> 000:31:30.079
Steph Wright: doing what we need to do.

337
000:31:30.580 --> 000:31:35.100
Steph Wright: So we would need to get that fixed, and that would need to be included in our recommendation.

338
000:31:35.270 --> 000:31:38.140
Steph Wright: And you've got it here. The returns data is missing.

339
000:31:38.270 --> 000:31:43.379
Steph Wright: It's just you then framing that as part of your recommendation. So

340
000:31:43.610 --> 000:31:45.100
Steph Wright: we need to fix that, please.

341
000:31:47.950 --> 000:32:08.719
Jack C: And then just one sorry. One final thing, you know, like, when you say state assumptions, you see, there's a line at the very bottom. That just is that is that how I think I was just? I'm not quite sure. Still, how to like where or how to state an assumption. Is it like at the bottom of the slide? Is it in the footnotes like?

342
000:32:11.000 --> 000:32:12.020
Jack C: So

343
000:32:12.290 --> 000:32:20.950
Jack C: it's a tricky one, I would say, if it's a massive assumption, some something like returns. And let's say that affected every single kpi

344
000:32:21.050 --> 000:32:24.530
Jack C: that you're looking at, then I would be stating it front and centre.

345
000:32:24.600 --> 000:32:34.519
Steph Wright: like we are lacking X months of data. This is going to affect the recommendations I can give you, because I can only speak to the end of 2021,

346
000:32:35.550 --> 000:32:40.330
Steph Wright: whereas if it's something that only affects this one Kpi.

347
000:32:40.890 --> 000:32:43.670
Steph Wright: then I would probably verbally state it here

348
000:32:43.680 --> 000:32:52.519
Steph Wright: and stick it in the speaker notes or an appendix something like that. If there's lots to those going on, I wouldn't usually give up valuable

349
000:32:53.190 --> 000:32:54.780
Steph Wright: screen real estate

350
000:32:55.390 --> 000:32:57.680
Steph Wright: to to have something like that.

351
000:33:00.650 --> 000:33:02.049
and I thank you

352
000:33:02.860 --> 000:33:10.309
Steph Wright: alright. So sorry. My screen has darkened, which means in the recording, things will be dark. I just need to try and get my title. Cable. 2 secs.

353
000:33:11.590 --> 000:33:18.389
Steph Wright: Going on to this one, Marcella. If you have any thoughts, please do while I try and find my charger.

354
000:33:18.420 --> 000:33:21.729
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay? So it's not a dark. Nope.

355
000:33:25.830 --> 000:33:26.520
hmm.

356
000:33:30.070 --> 000:33:33.280
Steph Wright: Nope, wait. Yes, we're plugged. Okay.

357
000:33:33.680 --> 000:33:34.800
Steph Wright: lovely.

358
000:33:36.960 --> 000:33:40.140
Steph Wright: So again, this looks like a dashboard wireframe.

359
000:33:40.460 --> 000:33:47.290
Eli Azlin: Yeah, so that's when. That's why I was the question in the beginning, because I was just confused and what we're gonna do but

360
000:33:47.540 --> 000:33:50.660
Eli Azlin: I think for this one because it doesn't.

361
000:33:51.330 --> 000:33:58.449
Eli Azlin: I don't think it's one of our most important kpis. because the way we were doing it initially was we were, gonna look at all 8.

362
000:33:58.840 --> 000:34:03.949
Eli Azlin: But after discussing a little bit, this one, the recommendation isn't as

363
000:34:04.340 --> 000:34:09.330
Eli Azlin: impactful as the other ones. So we might just keep it in the wireframe.

364
000:34:09.380 --> 000:34:11.050
Eli Azlin: But, like team orange

365
000:34:11.389 --> 000:34:14.870
Eli Azlin: and then do it. Based on that. I think.

366
000:34:16.400 --> 000:34:21.230
Steph Wright: And I like the way that you're thinking about that. It's yes. You spent some time looking at it.

367
000:34:21.340 --> 000:34:26.189
Steph Wright: But it's you know what this is, not what my stakeholders need to hear about.

368
000:34:26.270 --> 000:34:28.600
Steph Wright: because it's not what's gonna drive

369
000:34:28.820 --> 000:34:32.139
Steph Wright: profit. And if that's the result of your investigation.

370
000:34:32.560 --> 000:34:33.630
Steph Wright: Lovely.

371
000:34:34.389 --> 000:34:38.200
Steph Wright: I mean, I would be looking at that. My brain is going.

372
000:34:38.260 --> 000:34:46.539
Steph Wright: What's going on with shoes and bags right? If that's massive profit, like massive compared to everything else.

373
000:34:47.270 --> 000:34:48.800
Steph Wright: I would question.

374
000:34:49.820 --> 000:34:52.419
Steph Wright: is there something we could do to sell more of those?

375
000:34:53.969 --> 000:35:06.429
Steph Wright: And that that's where the we get into kind of forecasting as analysts. It's like, if we change this thing. And that meant we change so this many more shoes, we would make this much more money.

376
000:35:06.710 --> 000:35:09.170
Steph Wright: and that is where Pilot

377
000:35:09.330 --> 000:35:16.170
Steph Wright: come from is where A B tests come from. It's you. Seeing this graph and going, there is something.

378
000:35:16.210 --> 000:35:22.569
Steph Wright: something that I should be able to exploit here because you don't see differences in behaviour like that

379
000:35:22.880 --> 000:35:24.160
Steph Wright: very often.

380
000:35:25.200 --> 000:35:29.460
Steph Wright: And this is real data. So this is real differences in profit.

381
000:35:30.230 --> 000:35:41.489
Marcelo Lecocq: II can see, Eli. I can see a really good story here that I haven't. I'm not. I'm not as well as informed with the data. So you guys are, you've been working the in this data for 7 weeks. Now, if I'm not mistaken.

382
000:35:42.210 --> 000:35:48.119
Marcelo Lecocq: the brand, look at the brand there. So prism is its own label, right?

383
000:35:48.230 --> 000:35:55.350
Marcelo Lecocq: You got 2 types of things unlabel and others, or like brand brand brands and unlabel.

384
000:35:55.730 --> 000:36:02.779
Marcelo Lecocq: and I don't know what the profit margins are for each one. If you went to that to me, that'll be a really good insight that I

385
000:36:02.810 --> 000:36:04.900
Marcelo Lecocq: I didn't have before.

386
000:36:05.020 --> 000:36:20.469
Marcelo Lecocq: whether profit, what sort of levels of profits or profitability you you having for just 2 types of products, your own brand and your on your all the brands, and then, of course, in the dashboard you can provide. I wanna go into the next level right

387
000:36:20.580 --> 000:36:29.909
Marcelo Lecocq: in looking at my own brands. So I think you you it has to go, lex. Perhaps, as you mentioned, not as important as other kpis as your top 3.

388
000:36:30.260 --> 000:36:32.820
Marcelo Lecocq: But II see this as a potential

389
000:36:33.120 --> 000:36:37.679
Marcelo Lecocq: thing I haven't heard before. And and if you think about, you know, like someone like

390
000:36:37.790 --> 000:36:48.850
Marcelo Lecocq: a Tk. Max, no, no, which companies in the UK. Offer their own label, but also offer other brands. What's direct which one

391
000:36:49.400 --> 000:37:05.829
Steph Wright: sports direct? I'm pretty sure they do own Brian T-shirt socks, but they also do proper sport. I'll be honest with you. Not a sports.

392
000:37:08.680 --> 000:37:21.259
Marcelo Lecocq: There you go, and and it would be really interesting for for the overall audience like your own. II would assume your own label is far more profitable than others. But wh what happens if it's not?

393
000:37:21.690 --> 000:37:26.070
Steph Wright: Yeah, then then we've got to fix our own label.

394
000:37:26.180 --> 000:37:28.719
Steph Wright: Suddenly things get great again.

395
000:37:28.750 --> 000:37:39.500
Marcelo Lecocq: You see, I started with the hypothesis that selling your own value brand is more profitable than selling others. Can you check the hypothesis? And if not, what we need a remedial brand plan.

396
000:37:41.710 --> 000:37:43.469
Steph Wright: you're thinking like an analyst

397
000:37:45.110 --> 000:37:48.770
Steph Wright: does. So I have noticed

398
000:37:48.940 --> 000:37:58.780
Eli Azlin: the time, but it also noticed there aren't any slides from indigo, so I can spend there. I'm so sorry we've gone for 90 min. I really do hope it was a useful only 90 min. Yeah.

399
000:38:00.030 --> 000:38:01.340
Steph Wright: Okay, so

400
000:38:01.840 --> 000:38:10.400
Eli Azlin: kind of similarly, with this set out as the previous slide. So I need to change it. So it kind of matches, jokes a bit more.

401
000:38:11.700 --> 000:38:12.640
Steph Wright: So

402
000:38:13.130 --> 000:38:15.240
Steph Wright: both. And yeah. But it's

403
000:38:15.410 --> 000:38:16.220
Steph Wright: here.

404
000:38:16.330 --> 000:38:27.450
Steph Wright: You've got what you're talking about. We have a recommendation. We just need to that up. So it's got the the insights and the recommendations in that headline.

405
000:38:31.720 --> 000:38:52.240
Steph Wright: And then we've got this. Yes, bear remind you all having data added, like daily. So you might have a slightly longer line for 2022 could be worth going back to the thing that you've built screenshot because it would be easier to explain behavior when you don't have just

406
000:38:52.420 --> 000:38:54.469
Eli Azlin: single dog. But you do have the qualifier.

407
000:38:54.790 --> 000:38:56.749
Eli Azlin: Okay? Cool. Yeah.

408
000:38:58.310 --> 000:39:02.640
Marcelo Lecocq: And quick question. I think I had a comment on the presentation. I've seen this before.

409
000:39:02.780 --> 000:39:04.570
Eli Azlin: Umhm. Now, this

410
000:39:05.400 --> 000:39:06.420
Marcelo Lecocq: I

411
000:39:06.510 --> 000:39:18.729
Marcelo Lecocq: this is not really a time series is just it doesn't tell me over time. I I'll be looking for a time series that starts in early 2020, and finishes in 2,022.

412
000:39:18.830 --> 000:39:21.990
Marcelo Lecocq: But here you've got 2 years in the same

413
000:39:22.180 --> 000:39:23.420
Marcelo Lecocq: lowering. You see.

414
000:39:23.640 --> 000:39:32.459
Eli Azlin: I wasn't sure whether it's better to, just because I wanted to compare how the change in monthly uses

415
000:39:32.560 --> 000:39:34.349
Eli Azlin: kind of occurs throughout the year.

416
000:39:34.410 --> 000:40:03.309
Eli Azlin: For both 2020 and 2021. Cause then, you see the whole seasonal data. I feel like it's easier to see. But then your mind does work very similar. The comparison between the difference between years could be you could use something else, a different vision use as it was a proper time series. Okay.

417
000:40:03.860 --> 000:40:06.880
Marcelo Lecocq: that that would be my recommendation, and

418
000:40:07.380 --> 000:40:14.900
Marcelo Lecocq: also also for everybody that is observing this conversation right now. Companies hate seasonality.

419
000:40:15.790 --> 000:40:37.739
Marcelo Lecocq: every company, hey? Seasonality. So the word in the street is to smooth demand. Okay? Because predictable traffic. Some troughs send your share value all over the place, so they don't enjoy this pix and troughs. Okay, I want you to think, perhaps, as a business person, what can you do to suggest strategies to smooth that

420
000:40:37.860 --> 000:40:43.999
Marcelo Lecocq: it is great to find that, hey? December? Yes, normal is Christmas course. We sell more. Okay? But what can

421
000:40:44.090 --> 000:40:48.220
Marcelo Lecocq: with that in mind perspective? How can you help

422
000:40:48.510 --> 000:40:50.410
Marcelo Lecocq: to deal with the troughs.

423
000:40:51.690 --> 000:40:56.779
Eli Azlin: Okay?  So what I would say is that this graph.

424
000:40:57.270 --> 000:40:59.779
Steph Wright: this is really useful, Eda.

425
000:41:00.040 --> 000:41:15.600
Steph Wright: because it allowed you to look at this and very, very quickly see that the seasonality of those 2 years is basically the same, except maybe for December. You've got slightly different behavior across the 2 of them.

426
000:41:16.330 --> 000:41:20.929
Steph Wright: This is for you. This is what stays on your computer or in your cloud.

427
000:41:21.030 --> 000:41:33.220
Steph Wright: Cool? Yeah. And then the time series that runs the full 2 years. That's what makes it into the slide. It's the the difference between stuff we do for what's called visual inference.

428
000:41:33.600 --> 000:41:36.850
Steph Wright: and then stuff we do to visualize

429
000:41:36.940 --> 000:41:45.010
Steph Wright: the trends that we found with the visual inference. the inference one. You can do whatever the hell you like, as long as

430
000:41:45.130 --> 000:41:48.800
Steph Wright: it makes sense to you, and then the rest of it is.

431
000:41:48.870 --> 000:41:53.670
Steph Wright: what are the expectations of other people? Because it's

432
000:41:54.360 --> 000:41:57.099
Steph Wright: it's kind of like a bit like being a teacher.

433
000:41:57.310 --> 000:42:09.490
Steph Wright: The the responsibility is on you to make sure they take away from it what they need to take away from it. So if they're expecting a very long time series rather than this, which

434
000:42:09.740 --> 000:42:12.020
Steph Wright: again, intuitively, I prefer.

435
000:42:12.540 --> 000:42:20.529
Steph Wright: But that's because I find seasonality fascinating, and I don't want to smooth it out. I just want to understand it because people are weird.

436
000:42:21.670 --> 000:42:25.539
Eli Azlin: So I don't work in retail anymore. It's why I work with people.

437
000:42:26.170 --> 000:42:27.399
Eli Azlin: Okay, thank you.

438
000:42:28.660 --> 000:42:30.830
Steph Wright: And so here we've got.

439
000:42:31.460 --> 000:42:34.280
Steph Wright: I'm assuming the order is intentional

440
000:42:35.000 --> 000:42:35.960
Steph Wright: with

441
000:42:36.510 --> 000:42:38.490
Steph Wright: these conversion rates

442
000:42:38.590 --> 000:42:44.820
Steph Wright: going down. You could get away with that in a small table. Potentially.

443
000:42:45.500 --> 000:42:50.149
Steph Wright: I would mainly because you've written out average of conversion rate 3 times.

444
000:42:50.600 --> 000:43:00.439
Steph Wright: and I'm of the opinion. If something happens 3 times, then it is generalisable. Usually it's write some goddamn code stuff to do this thing that you keep repeating.

445
000:43:00.610 --> 000:43:03.790
Steph Wright: So if you had a table that was average conversion rate.

446
000:43:04.260 --> 000:43:05.220
Steph Wright: Yeah.

447
000:43:05.840 --> 000:43:10.869
Steph Wright: like that, that's very easy. You get that same comparative effect

448
000:43:11.090 --> 000:43:18.610
Steph Wright: what! You've saved a lot of space on screen that either make your visual bigger. Give yourself a subtitle, add an insight.

449
000:43:19.010 --> 000:43:21.330
Steph Wright: That sort of thing. Now

450
000:43:22.720 --> 000:43:25.380
Steph Wright: I know you're still working in hypotheticals.

451
000:43:25.590 --> 000:43:31.130
Steph Wright: This is the sort of thing that we're very, very used to getting as a recommendation.

452
000:43:31.260 --> 000:43:32.780
Steph Wright: Do an A B test.

453
000:43:33.450 --> 000:43:36.330
Steph Wright: Guess what the question's going to be.

454
000:43:36.550 --> 000:43:40.630
Steph Wright: If that's the level of detail that comes in the headline.

455
000:43:41.110 --> 000:43:45.089
Steph Wright: Anyone, what am I going to ask if I am your stakeholder.

456
000:43:49.140 --> 000:43:57.900
Jack C: What's the a test? Do you want me to do? What am I signing off giving you money

457
000:43:58.080 --> 000:43:59.889
Steph Wright: to go and investigate.

458
000:44:00.660 --> 000:44:09.309
Steph Wright: So it's a B test on insert variable here to prevent another

459
000:44:09.560 --> 000:44:36.760
Marcelo Lecocq: crash. And mostly it's one for you getting rid of a crash. We are smoothing a time series. II think I think this 60% there, the title that's that's a headline right? There's a crash coming. You're telling them the trend is coming. It's gonna repeat itself. Panic, panic button. And what am I gonna do to prevent it? First of all, where do we think there is a problem in the conversion rate. Wh. What is the conversion rate? To begin with.

460
000:44:38.090 --> 000:44:39.960
Marcelo Lecocq: clicks to sail?

461
000:44:42.580 --> 000:44:47.429
Marcelo Lecocq: What is the conversion? Kind of someone answer this. What is the conversion rate. Definition.

462
000:44:47.560 --> 000:44:49.840
Marisa Sharma: Think purchases to visit

463
000:44:49.890 --> 000:44:52.800
Marisa Sharma:  Viewed items.

464
000:44:53.940 --> 000:45:01.520
Marcelo Lecocq: viewed items versus to to sales conversion. Okay. Now, you saw from the actual slide slide slide 18.

465
000:45:01.850 --> 000:45:03.860
Marcelo Lecocq: If you look at slide 18.

466
000:45:04.930 --> 000:45:24.560
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay, conversion. We're talking about pick throughs. Right? So people are viewing our stuff they get. They, we're getting. We're getting users to go to the website. So that's not really changing, increasing dramatically or or declining, so must be something else in your operation that is causing your your conversion rate to go low.

467
000:45:24.800 --> 000:45:28.100
Marcelo Lecocq: It's not the views we got, more people viewing

468
000:45:28.250 --> 000:45:32.259
Marcelo Lecocq: what is causing your conversion rate to go down.

469
000:45:32.970 --> 000:45:34.799
Marcelo Lecocq: Do you have an hypothesis.

470
000:45:36.030 --> 000:45:38.629
What? What is the hypothesis of the Merton rate?

471
000:45:41.360 --> 000:45:48.849
Marisa Sharma: I wasn't sure I was trying to figure out, but maybe something to do with the increase in maximum on the other graph below

472
000:45:49.120 --> 000:45:52.880
Marcelo Lecocq: increasing Meta. So you're getting more viewers.

473
000:45:53.460 --> 000:45:55.390
Marcelo Lecocq: But they're not alerting.

474
000:45:55.510 --> 000:45:56.530
Okay?

475
000:45:56.860 --> 000:46:02.000
Marcelo Lecocq: So one of the hypotheses like mete is providing crap customers.

476
000:46:02.210 --> 000:46:12.359
Marcelo Lecocq: Okay? Assuming that all your operations are very good, you don't have any issues with simply, Meta is capturing, perhaps the wrong audience for you.

477
000:46:12.820 --> 000:46:23.769
Marcelo Lecocq: Ok, that'll be my my safest guess, unless you go on operational challenge, that you cannot get that user through the entire life cycle and sell them something.

478
000:46:24.180 --> 000:46:34.170
Marcelo Lecocq: So here, you blaming meta quality ability to capture good quality customers, or you're blaming yourself somewhere in your own operations that you're failing.

479
000:46:34.360 --> 000:46:36.020
I don't know which one is which. But

480
000:46:36.160 --> 000:46:46.750
Marcelo Lecocq: but I think you got the idea, don't you? And depending, depending on which one d. Which one you select, depend depends on what your advice on the AV testing is going to be

481
000:46:51.880 --> 000:47:16.200
Marcelo Lecocq: being dug into like, I didn't think we were going to get into proper analytics today, and I've missed it like I'm genuinely surprised how much I'll be joining, looking through this and sorry sorry about that potential. Everything is there. It just needs to be put in a package that people receive a well, that's all. Everything is there.

482
000:47:17.550 --> 000:47:19.710
Steph Wright: I'm going to stop sharing my screen now.

483
000:47:21.100 --> 000:47:23.410
Steph Wright: but it's do you remember.

484
000:47:24.230 --> 000:47:27.719
Steph Wright: early early in acquire.

485
000:47:28.350 --> 000:47:34.150
Steph Wright: and I said to you, the very best thing that you could do with data was to play with it.

486
000:47:36.560 --> 000:47:37.720
Steph Wright: This is why

487
000:47:38.380 --> 000:47:57.410
Steph Wright: it's not just to teach you what's there and the small things that you can do with it. It's if you see something, and you're like, what the hell did that happen? And you dig and you join tables, and you calculate some aggregates, and you do some other things. You will potentially find out that matters rubbish

488
000:47:57.560 --> 000:47:59.420
Steph Wright: bringing customers.

489
000:47:59.550 --> 000:48:02.710
Steph Wright: even though they're probably the most expensive

490
000:48:02.910 --> 000:48:04.959
Steph Wright: of those ad platforms.

491
000:48:05.990 --> 000:48:19.750
Steph Wright: So, depending on which team you are working in, you might pass that on to another team to work out because it falls under them. They're in the marketing lot. It might be that it's your team that should be dealing with any dig in

492
000:48:19.780 --> 000:48:21.210
Steph Wright: a little bit more.

493
000:48:21.750 --> 000:48:30.509
Steph Wright: But this is why, as we go through the the projects will not necessarily get more complicated. But you'll need to really choose

494
000:48:30.860 --> 000:48:32.550
Steph Wright: what to focus on

495
000:48:33.590 --> 000:48:37.860
Steph Wright: in terms of. There are many things we could try.

496
000:48:37.960 --> 000:48:46.199
Steph Wright: Because, like I said, this is real data. It hasn't been manipulated to have a specific trend that happens at a specific date.

497
000:48:46.400 --> 000:48:49.249
Steph Wright: It's these are real people's buying habits.

498
000:48:50.300 --> 000:48:54.240
Steph Wright: So it's we just play. We go. Let's give it a shot.

499
000:48:54.700 --> 000:48:56.270
Steph Wright: See what happens.

500
000:48:56.620 --> 000:49:00.910
Steph Wright: And as long as it is easy for your stakeholder to go.

501
000:49:01.200 --> 000:49:06.980
Steph Wright: Oh, this is a problem. Oh, you have a solution. and this is what

502
000:49:07.990 --> 000:49:10.630
Steph Wright: here is money. Go do the things

503
000:49:10.680 --> 000:49:16.139
Steph Wright: right? That's the response you'll get, because your senior stakeholders want you to solve their problems.

504
000:49:16.180 --> 000:49:18.049
Steph Wright: They do not want to have to solve

505
000:49:18.070 --> 000:49:21.669
Steph Wright: their problems. So you need to show you understand the problem.

506
000:49:22.900 --> 000:49:24.659
Steph Wright: You've gone through the data

507
000:49:25.160 --> 000:49:30.060
Steph Wright: and you have a I cannot stress this enough a specific

508
000:49:30.470 --> 000:49:41.340
Steph Wright: recommendation. It is better to have a specific one that you could say based on my investigation. It will cause an increase in the profit margin of naught. Point 1.

509
000:49:42.210 --> 000:49:45.930
Steph Wright: Then to go. Let's increase profit. Margin

510
000:49:48.480 --> 000:49:52.119
Steph Wright: right? Increase it by 10%. Sounds better.

511
000:49:53.070 --> 000:49:55.899
Steph Wright: But it doesn't show that I've got any idea how I'm going to get there.

512
000:49:56.970 --> 000:50:00.899
Steph Wright: whereas if I've got a almost guaranteed 0 point 1 increase

513
000:50:01.700 --> 000:50:07.879
Steph Wright: that will win the day in real life the thing that we can actually foresee happening.

514
000:50:08.060 --> 000:50:11.480
Steph Wright: And as stakeholders, it's your slides

515
000:50:11.890 --> 000:50:15.380
Steph Wright: that allows to understand that story.

516
000:50:15.670 --> 000:50:22.570
Steph Wright: And that's why we need them to be clear. We need them to be clean, to have these specific bits of information in.

517
000:50:22.680 --> 000:50:27.780
Steph Wright: Because then when we ask you questions. they're gonna be interesting questions that you want to answer

518
000:50:27.990 --> 000:50:31.640
Steph Wright: rather than filling in the gaps that you're like.

519
000:50:31.760 --> 000:50:37.269
Steph Wright: Oh, we've done really badly, you haven't. But that's what your brain is. Gonna tell you on the day.

520
000:50:39.030 --> 000:50:43.400
Steph Wright: so start them early. Number one, tilt tip

521
000:50:43.870 --> 000:50:49.010
Steph Wright: number 2, get them reviewed early by other people.

522
000:50:49.710 --> 000:50:51.949
Steph Wright: and set yourself some rules.

523
000:50:52.620 --> 000:50:59.629
Steph Wright: but must be on every slide. and then, if you can take each of those off

524
000:51:00.010 --> 000:51:04.630
Steph Wright: and you haven't ticked any of the, do not put these on a slide for pain of death

525
000:51:05.370 --> 000:51:06.580
Steph Wright: pie charts.

526
000:51:08.240 --> 000:51:11.150
Steph Wright: Then you're fine and you will get there.

527
000:51:12.310 --> 000:51:13.150
Steph Wright: I've just.

528
000:51:13.420 --> 000:51:18.539
Steph Wright: dean that we are. We are at Part 3 can. Can I just

529
000:51:18.550 --> 000:51:22.899
Steph Wright: get? Because I'm trying to work out whether I should run one of these next week

530
000:51:24.000 --> 000:51:35.500
Steph Wright: on a scale of one to 10, and I'm not gonna be upset if it's a low number, right? One is status. This wasn't useful. Okay, we could have done with the hour and a half to just work on our sides.

531
000:51:35.660 --> 000:51:39.270
Steph Wright: 10 is actually, I'm going to completely rethink

532
000:51:39.490 --> 000:51:41.170
Steph Wright: what it was we were doing

533
000:51:41.360 --> 000:51:44.770
Steph Wright: roughly whereabouts. And are we kicking about with this sort of thing.

534
000:51:49.560 --> 000:51:53.040
Steph Wright: Okay. 5 outputs. So

535
000:51:53.710 --> 000:52:01.860
Steph Wright: I will post the the recording of this into the slack channel when I do. If there's any suggestions

536
000:52:02.290 --> 000:52:05.729
Steph Wright: for how this could be more useful.

537
000:52:05.990 --> 000:52:07.749
Steph Wright: Just throw them in there

538
000:52:08.520 --> 000:52:12.900
Steph Wright: right, please don't be brutal. Remember, constructive feedback is kind.

539
000:52:13.790 --> 000:52:18.040
Steph Wright: But if there are things that didn't work, if there are things that would work better.

540
000:52:18.800 --> 000:52:20.150
Steph Wright: let us know, and then

541
000:52:20.190 --> 000:52:23.619
Steph Wright: we can kind of see what to do moving forward.

542
000:52:24.540 --> 000:52:29.039
Steph Wright:  Any quick questions before I have to toddle off.

543
000:52:29.750 --> 000:52:34.430
Steph Wright: because I'll be honest with you. I have now been pretty much sat still for 3 h.

544
000:52:35.610 --> 000:52:51.270
Marcelo Lecocq: Everybody, if you couldn't vote to put post your scores on the on, on the meeting chat. What? What, Steph asked you is super relevant for us to to get your feedback. What was the mean then

545
000:52:51.360 --> 000:53:12.700
Marcelo Lecocq: the the mean, I'd say, was probably 7, which will piss James off no end, cause he doesn't know. I can see. I can see it's coming biasing the the mean. It's really important. On Friday you're very likely to have another little 10 min survey for feedback about this week, and every week from now on. Alright.

546
000:53:12.700 --> 000:53:31.540
Marcelo Lecocq: this is this is, gonna be for us to enhance the material. We deliver the Co. The connections with you guys, and for you, and opportunity to tell us what works for you or doesn't work for you. Okay, and this is, gonna be helpful for yourself for the remain remainder of the course, but also for future generations of Co over students. So really appreciate your feedback on Friday. Yeah.

547
000:53:33.050 --> 000:53:33.960
Steph Wright: I'm gonna

548
000:53:34.070 --> 000:53:35.739
Steph Wright: stop recording before I own this.
