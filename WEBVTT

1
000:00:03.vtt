Marcelo Lecocq: Now, what we're gonna try to do now is to record a second video

2
000:00:10.180 --> 000:00:11.949
to be able to

3
000:00:11.960 --> 000:00:28.250
Marcelo Lecocq: imported or read it from python using the Api calls we've designed. And there is another video in place much shorter. What we will try to do with this is to read the second a second file

4
000:00:28.650 --> 000:00:41.699
Marcelo Lecocq: that's going to be living in the zoom cloud, as we'll record meetings. Now, it's important to understand. Also, when we run out of space we won't be able to use. This might have to create

5
000:00:41.950 --> 000:00:44.800
Marcelo Lecocq: a different mechanism of read this

6
000:00:44.950 --> 000:00:47.440
Marcelo Lecocq: exported recordings from

7
000:00:47.530 --> 000:00:50.710
Marcelo Lecocq: Go Go Cloud or Google Drive.

8
000:00:51.210 --> 000:00:56.360
Marcelo Lecocq: So this only works if the recording leafs inside

9
000:00:57.130 --> 000:01:04.229
Marcelo Lecocq: or the VTB. Dt file, which is the transcription recorded, lives inside the Sun cloud.

10
000:01:04.769 --> 000:01:08.729
Marcelo Lecocq: So I'm gonna stop the recording now and see if I can access this video.
